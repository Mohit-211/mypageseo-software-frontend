# Endpoints

**The single source of truth for every current endpoint** (method, path, auth, purpose, phase added, status). Request and response examples for the rebuilt endpoints are in [API.md](API.md). [ROUTES.md](ROUTES.md) is a frozen Phase 1 snapshot (with the audit findings) and is no longer updated.

**Rule (Mohit, 2026-09-26):**
- Every commit that adds, changes or removes an endpoint updates this file in the **same commit**, and [API.md](API.md) too when a request or response shape changes.
- `npm run check:endpoints` loads the Express app, lists every registered route and compares it with the catalogue below. It fails on a route missing here, on an entry here with no route, on a bad status (there is no `deprecated` status: unused endpoints are deleted, Phase 13b), and on a detail-table row (`#`) that isn't in the catalogue. It runs as part of `npm test`.

**Status values:**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| live | Registered in every environment |
| behind flag | Registered, but answers only when a config flag enables it (the flag is named in the purpose) |
| dev only | Registered only when `NODE_ENV=development`; never in test or production |

**Phase:** `legacy` = from the old codebase and not rebuilt; `legacy, rebuilt N` = old path, rebuilt in phase N; otherwise the phase that added it.

## Conventions

**Base URL:** `/api/v1`. Local: `http://localhost:5055/api/v1`.

**Postman:** `docs/postman/MyPageSEO.postman_collection.json` + `MyPageSEO.local.postman_environment.json`, generated from this catalogue by `npm run postman:generate` (rerun after changing the catalogue).

**Auth:**
- `admin` (Phase 10): header `Authorization: Bearer <admin session token>` from `POST /admin/auth/login` (HS256, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, 12 h). `admin (\`<permission>\`)` also needs that permission: `admins.manage` (super admin), `platform.read` / `platform.write` (super admin, admin), `content.manage` (super admin, admin, editor), `citations.view` and `citations.manage` (Phase 16; super admin, admin, editor), `billing.read` and `billing.manage` (Phase 13a; super admin, admin), `support.read` and `support.manage` (Phase 13b; super admin, admin, editor). No token or an invalid one → **401**; a missing permission → **403** `{ reason: "forbidden", permission }`.
- `user`: header `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`. A missing or invalid token gives **401**.
- `owner` (location routes, Phase 8): the caller must be an active member of the location's **organization** (a `client_user` only for its clients' locations). Otherwise **404**; a malformed id gives **400**. Writes (anything but GET) need the role owner or member: a `client_user` gets **403** `{ reason: "read_only" }`.
- `org`: the route acts in the current organization: the `X-Organization-Id` header (one of the caller's organizations, else **403** `not_a_member`), otherwise the user's default organization. A user without an organization gets **403** `{ reason: "no_organization" }`.
- `none`: no MyPageSEO login (the Google OAuth callback, and the Phase 8 `/auth` endpoints).

**Roles (Phase 8):** `owner` (everything), `member` (everything except editing the organization), `client_user` (agency; read-only, only its assigned clients and their locations).

**Response envelope:** every response is `{ "success": bool, "status": number, "message": string, "data": … }`.

**Common errors:**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid input, or a missing precondition |
| 401 | No or invalid login |
| 404 | Not found, or not yours |
| 409 | Conflict |
| 422 | Run over the call cap |
| 402 | Payment situations only (Phase 13a): `subscription_required` (trial over / no subscription / grace expired), `location_payment_required` (with a prorated `quote`), `insufficient_tokens` |
| 403 | Phase 8: no access with a `reason` (`read_only`, `agency_only`, `owner_only`, `email_not_verified`, …); Phase 13a: `enterprise_required` (beyond the plan's location cap), `user_limit_reached`, `feature_not_included`; 13c: `organization_suspended` (an admin suspended the organization; reads keep working) |
| 429 | Daily search limit, or an auth rate limit (`rate_limited`, `retry_after_seconds`) |
| 502 | Google failed |
| 503 | Not configured / GBP access not approved |

---

## Billing gates (Phase 13a)

**402 `subscription_required`** answers these when the organization is read-only (trial over without a subscription, a failed payment past its 7-day grace, an overdue manual invoice past grace). The body is `{ reason, billing: { state, trial_ends_at } }`; an admin suspension gives **403** `{ reason: "organization_suspended" }` instead (13c: 402 is only for payment situations).
- `POST /locations`, `POST /gbp/picks/:pickId/bind` (new location; 2026-10-01), `POST /onboarding/complete`, `PUT /locations/:id/center`
- `GET /places/search`, `GET /locations/:id/competitor-suggestions`
- `PUT /locations/:id/tracking`, `POST /locations/:id/rank-runs`, `POST /locations/:id/refresh`
- `POST /reports`, `POST /reports/:id/email`, `POST /report-schedules`, `PATCH /report-schedules/:id`

Reads, billing, support and GBP connect / bind stay open.

**403 `feature_not_included`** answers the feature routes when the organization's plan switches that feature off. All features are on in the standard plan:
- rank tracker / grid / map ranking
- GBP report
- citations
- `POST /reports`
- the white-label branding writes

## Summary (2026-10-01)

**232 endpoints:** 231 live, 1 dev-only.
- **By origin:** 197 rebuilt or new, 35 legacy.
- **By auth:** 104 user, 92 platform admin (each with a permission), 36 none.

This block is recounted with every commit that changes the catalogue.

**Phase 16 (citations):** the 13 legacy `/citation/*` routes were retired. It added 23 `/admin/citations/*` routes (#82–#104) and 2 customer routes (#105–#106), and the report type `citation` (#61).

**Phase 13a (billing):** the 15 legacy plan / guest-checkout / coupon / payment-list / Square routes were retired. It added 14 `/billing` routes and the public `/pricing` (#107–#121), and 30 `/admin/billing/*` routes (#122–#151; the 2 legacy-payment links #149–#150 were removed in 13b); the PayPal webhook kept its path with new handlers.

**Phase 13b step 1 (legacy removal):** 40 legacy routes deleted (no deprecated routes remain; the status no longer exists), the read-only `GET /admin/roles` added. Details in [LEGACY_FEATURES.md](LEGACY_FEATURES.md) "Removed in Phase 13b".

**Phase 13b step 2:** sessions and the account moved to `/auth/*` (6 routes: refresh, logout, change-password, me GET/PATCH, deactivate); the legacy `/user/auth` session routes and `/user/profile` were deleted. The Google connect routes then moved to `/gbp/connect/*` + `POST /gbp/disconnect`, and `POST /gbp/bind-with-user` became `POST /gbp/bind`, so no `/user/*` route remains.

**Phase 13b legacy sweep:** `/system/*` (4) and `GET/DELETE /logs` removed (the `system.read` permission with them).

**Phase 13b password links:** no OTP or code remains. User reset is by link (`/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`); the admin OTP routes (`sendOTP`, `verifyOTP`, `forgotPassword`) and the legacy-shaped admin routes (`register`, `getAllAdmins`, `getAdminById/:id`, `getProfile`, `resetPassword`, `updateAdmin`, `deleteAdmin`) were replaced by `/admin/auth/{login, forgot-password, reset-password, change-password, me}` and `/admin/admins`.

## Catalogue: all current endpoints

Paths are full paths. Auth: `none`, `user` (user access token), `user + org` (acts in the current organization), `user + owner` (member of the location's organization, otherwise 404), `refresh token`, `admin`. The security findings for legacy routes (S1–S30) are in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) and the [ROUTES.md](ROUTES.md) snapshot.

### Citations (Phase 16)

Manual, admin-managed citation tracking (no external citation APIs). Admin routes need a platform-admin token with `citations.view` (read) or `citations.manage` (write). Examples: [API.md](API.md#citations-phase-16).

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/admin/citations/directories` | admin (`citations.view`) | Directory master list (search, type, country, category, active; paginated) | 16 | live |

### Ranking: tracking settings and runs (Phase 5)

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Path params | Query params | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/tracking` | user, owner | `locationId` | – | – | Tracking settings (defaults filled) + the API-call estimate for a run, `expected_duration_ms`, `cap`, `over_cap`, `competitors: [{ place_id, name, address, lat, lng }]` (17) |
| 2 | PUT | `/locations/:locationId/tracking` | user, owner | `locationId` | – | At least one of the fields below | Saved settings, estimate, `keywords_version_bumped`, `onboarding_step` (onboarding locations only) |
| 152 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/tracking/estimate` | user, owner | `locationId` | `size` (3–13 odd), `radius_km` (0.5–15) or `spacing_km` (0.1–15), `keywords` (a count, 1–100); each defaults to the saved settings | – | `{ grid: { size, spacing_km, radius_km }, keywords, points_per_keyword, tracker_offset_km, estimate, expected_duration_ms, cap, over_cap, dev_capped, token_cost: { rankings } }`; **400** `invalid_grid` |
| 153 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/keyword-groups` | user, owner | `locationId` | – | – | `{ groups: [{ group_id, name, keywords }], limit: 20 }` |
| 154 | POST | `/locations/:locationId/keyword-groups` | user, owner (write) | `locationId` | – | `{ name: 1–60, keywords: string[] (≥ 1, tracked) }` | **201** `{ group_id, name, keywords }`; **400** `unknown_keyword` (+ `keywords`), `too_many_groups`; **409** `group_name_taken` |
| 155 | PATCH | `/locations/:locationId/keyword-groups/:groupId` | user, owner (write) | `locationId`, `groupId` | – | `{ name?, keywords? }` (at least one) | the group; **404** `group_not_found`; as #154 |
| 156 | DELETE | `/locations/:locationId/keyword-groups/:groupId` | user, owner (write) | `locationId`, `groupId` | – | – | `{ deleted: true, group_id }`; **404** `group_not_found` |
| 157 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/keyword-history` | user, owner | `locationId` | `keyword` (required, any case), `limit` (1–24, default 12) | – | `{ keyword, runs: [{ run_id, run_at, status, keywords_version, targets, summary: { [target]: { avgRank, foundRate, top3Rate, change, changeLabel } } }] }`, oldest first; runs without the keyword are skipped; **404** `keyword_not_tracked` |
| 3 | POST | `/locations/:locationId/rank-runs` | user, owner | `locationId` | – | – | **202** `{ run_id, status, existing, estimate, dev_capped }`; **402** `insufficient_tokens` (13a) |
| 4 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/rank-runs` | user, owner | `locationId` | `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 15, max 100) | – | Run history: `{ runs: [{ run_id, run_at, status, trigger, keywords_version, overall, targets (17) }], page, limit, total }` |
| 5 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/rank-runs/:runId` | user, owner | `locationId`, `runId` | – | – | Run status, timings, `api_calls`, estimate (12.5: + `samples`, `mapPoints`), `config` (`samples`, `sample_spacing_sec`, `map_points`), `expected_duration_ms`, `errors_count`, `failure_reason` |

**Body fields for #2** (all optional; send at least one):

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `keywords` | string[]: 1–20 keywords, each 2–80 characters. Duplicates are merged ignoring case. Changing the set bumps `keywords_version`. |
| `competitors` | string[]: up to 5 place IDs, not your own. `[]` means none. **400** `too_many_competitors`, `own_place_id`, `invalid_place_id` (17). The response's `competitors` gives each one's `name`, `address`, `lat`, `lng` (17). |
| `grid` | Phase 17: `{ size: 3 \| 5 \| 7 \| 9 \| 11 \| 13, radius_km: 0.5–15 }` or `{ size, spacing_km: 0.1–15 }` (one of the two; the other is derived: spacing = radius ÷ ((size − 1) / 2), and both must stay in range). **400** `invalid_grid`. Default for a new location: `{ size: 7, radius_km: 8 }`. The Rank Tracker and Map Ranking points sit at radius ÷ 2 (at least 0.5 km). |
| `frequency` | `'auto_monthly'` (default: refreshed monthly) \| `'manual_only'` (only on demand). Sending `next_run_at` is rejected (400). |

**Notes:**
- **#3:** "run now" is a rankings refresh: it shares the **24 h manual-refresh limit** with #25 and returns **429** `{ next_allowed_at }` inside the window. Returns **400** without a `place_id`, without keywords, or when the country is not US/CA; **422** when over `RANK_MAX_CALLS_PER_RUN`. If a run is already active it returns that run with `existing: true` (no limit used). In development the run is capped at 2 keywords and a 3×3 grid.
- **#5:** returns **404** for an unknown run.

### Ranking: report pages (Phase 5)

All three read the latest `done` or `partial` run, or the run given by `runId`.

| 7 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/grid` | user, owner | `locationId` | `runId` (optional), `keyword` (optional, 1–80 chars) | **Local Search Grid page:** grid size and spacing; per keyword, the summary and every point (`row`, `col`, `lat`, `lng`, rank display) |
| 8 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/map-ranking` | user, owner | `locationId` | `runId` (optional), `keyword` (optional), `resolveNames` (optional boolean; only when `STORE_PLACE_NAMES=false`), `point` (12.5: `C` default, `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `all`) | **Local Map Ranking page:** per keyword and point, the top 20 (`rank`, `place_id`, `name`, `is_self`, `target_key`), plus `point`, `points_available`, `attribution`. **404** for a point the run doesn't have (runs before 12.5: center only) |

**404** means there is no completed run yet, an unknown `runId`, or a keyword not in the run. **409** means the `runId` isn't finished.

### GBP connection (Phase 6, updated in 7a)

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Query params | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | GET | `/gbp/connect/url` | user | – | – | Google consent URL (**redirect flow**, the fallback). One-time `state`, valid 10 minutes. |
| 10 | GET | `/gbp/connect/callback` | none (Google calls it) | `code`, `state`, `error` (from Google) | – | **302** to `FRONTEND_URL/gbp/connect/callback?status=success\|denied\|error&message=…`; without `FRONTEND_URL`: `{ connected: true, google_email, google_sub }` (400 on errors) |
| 11 | GET | `/gbp/connect/popup` | user | – | – | **Popup flow** config for Google Identity Services: `{ client_id, scope, state, ux_mode: "popup", select_account: true }` |
| 12 | POST | `/gbp/connect/code` | user | – | `{ code, state }` (from the popup callback) | `{ connected: true, google_email, google_sub }` |
| 13 | POST | `/gbp/disconnect` | user | – | `{ google_sub? }` | **Disconnect one Google account:** `{ revoked, bindings_removed, picks_removed, google_email }` |
| 14 | GET | `/gbp/connections` | user + org | – | – | `{ limit: 3, connections: [{ google_sub, google_email, status: active\|revoked, picked, bound }] }` |
| 14a | GET | `/gbp/connections/:googleSub/locations` | user + org | `googleSub` | – | `{ google_sub, google_email, locations: [{ gbpAccountId, gbpLocationId, title, address, city, region_code, place_id, supported, picked, picked_by_other, pick_id, bound_location_id }], errors }`; **404** `google_account_not_connected` |
| 14b | PUT | `/gbp/connections/:googleSub/picks` | user + org (owner/member) | `googleSub` | `{ gbp_location_ids: ["locations/…"] }` | as #14a + `{ picked, removed, kept_bound }`; **400** `unknown_location`, `unsupported_region`; **409** `picked_by_other` |
| 15 | POST | `/gbp/picks/:pickId/bind` | user + org (owner/member) | `pickId` | `{ client_id? }` | `{ pick_id, location: { location_id, name, address, place_id, lat, lng }, created, center_needed, binding }`; **402** `subscription_required` / `location_payment_required` (+ `quote`), **403** `enterprise_required`, **409** `already_bound`, `place_id_mismatch` |
| 15a | DELETE | `/gbp/picks/:pickId` | user + org (owner/member) | `pickId` | – | `{ removed, pick_id }`; **409** `already_bound` |
| 16 | POST | `/gbp/unbind` | user | – | `{ location_id }` | `{ unbound, jobs_cancelled: { gbp_sync, scheduled_posts } }` |

**Notes:**
- **#9:** scopes `openid email business.manage`, with `prompt=select_account consent`.
- **#10:** returns **400** for an unknown, expired or reused state, `error=access_denied`, or an unverifiable Google account. A user can connect **several Google accounts**: a new account is added as its own connection (`google_sub`), and the same account again updates it.
- **#11:** the `state` is valid 10 minutes and works once. Scopes are the same as #9. There is no `prompt` / `access_type` in the popup settings (GIS doesn't support them).
- **#12:** the code is exchanged with `redirect_uri=postmessage`. The state must be a popup state belonging to the caller. Errors as #10.
- **#13:** revokes that Google account at Google (best effort), then unbinds its locations (they stay as locations without GBP), cancels their scheduled jobs and removes its picks and tokens.
- **#14 (2026-10-01):** up to 3 Google accounts per user (`POST /gbp/connect/code` answers **409** `google_account_limit` for a 4th, and revokes it at Google). Reconnecting the same account refreshes it. `status: revoked` means connect it again.
- **#14a / #14b:** read from Business Information only (no Places calls). Picking is free and creates no location; leaving an unbound pick out of the list removes it, bound ones stay (unbind first).
- **#15:** reads the profile from Google (1 GBP call). A profile whose place is already a location of the organization is linked (no new location slot); otherwise a location is created through the subscription limits.
- **#16:** cancels the location's sync jobs and pending scheduled posts and removes its pick. The Google connection stays (2026-10-01: disconnect is explicit).

### Onboarding (Phase 7a)

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Path / query params | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | GET | `/onboarding/state` | user | – | – | `{ gbp: { connected, connections: [{ google_sub, google_email, status }] }, locations: [{ location_id, name, onboarding: { step, started_at, completed_at } }] }` |
| 19b | PUT | `/locations/:locationId/center` | user, owner | `locationId` | `{ query }` (city or ZIP, 2–100 chars) | `{ lat, lng, center_source: "manual", center_label, api_calls, onboarding_step? }` |
| 20 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/competitor-suggestions` | user, owner | `locationId`; query `refresh` (optional boolean) | – | `{ generated_at, cached, keywords_used, api_calls, suggestions: [{ place_id, name, address, rating, userRatingCount, best_position, keywords, already_selected }], attribution }` |
| 21 | GET | `/places/search` | user, owner (via `locationId`) | query `q` (required, 2–100 chars), `locationId` (required, 24-hex) | – | `{ results: [{ place_id, name, address }], api_calls, attribution }` |
| 22 | POST | `/onboarding/complete` | user | – | `{ location_id }` | `{ completed, completed_at, rank_run: { run_id, status, existing }, gbp_sync: { sync_id, status, existing } \| { error }, refresh: { anchor_day, next_refresh_at } }` |

**Notes:**
- **#17:** use it to resume. Each connection's `status` is `active` or `revoked` (reconnect). `step` goes `profile_selected` → (`center_needed` → `center_set`, service-area only) → `keywords_set` → `competitors_set` → `completed`.
- **#19:** links `location_id` if given, else your location with the same place ID, else creates a new Location from the profile. Then it binds (1 GBP call). `google_sub` is required with several Google accounts. `center_needed: true` means the profile has no coordinates (service-area business), so #19b comes next. Returns **400** for a non-US/CA profile or one the account can't access, **404** if `location_id` is not yours.
- **#19b:** resolves a city or ZIP once: 1 Places Text Search (IDs-only, free SKU) + 1 Place Details (`location` only), counted against the daily Places limit. It saves the location's lat/lng with `center_source: "manual"`. Rank runs and suggestions then use it. Returns **404** if nothing is found, **429** at the daily limit, **502** if Google failed.
- **#20:** top 10 competitors across your keywords. 1 Places Enterprise search per keyword (2 in development). Cached 24 hours per keyword set. Returns **400** with no keywords or no coordinates, **429** at the daily limit, **502** if every search failed.
- **#21:** 1 Places Pro call, up to 10 results near the location, excluding the location itself. Returns **404** if `locationId` is not yours, **429** at the daily limit.
- **#22:** needs a bound profile, a center (lat/lng) and at least 1 keyword. It queues the first rank run **and the first GBP sync**, and sets the monthly refresh (the setup day of the month, clamped to 28, at about 03:00 local). Calling it again returns the same state. Returns **422** if the run is over the call cap.

**Onboarding keywords and competitors** use the ranking endpoint #2 (`PUT /locations/:locationId/tracking`). Sending `keywords` moves the step to `keywords_set` (except while it is `center_needed`); sending `competitors` (even `[]`) moves it to `competitors_set`.

**Daily Places limit:** #19b, #20 and #21 share `PLACES_USER_DAILY_LIMIT` (default 50) calls per user per UTC day.

---

### Refresh and GBP sync (Phase 7b)

Every location refreshes **automatically once a month** (rankings, then the GBP sync if connected). Users can also refresh on demand, at most once per 24 h per type.

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Params / body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | POST | `/locations/:locationId/refresh` | user, owner | body `{ types?: ["rankings","gbp"] }` (default: rankings, plus gbp when connected) | **202** `{ rankings: { run_id, status, existing, estimate, next_allowed_at } \| { skipped: 'rate_limited', next_allowed_at }, gbp: { sync_id, status, existing, estimated_calls, next_allowed_at } \| { skipped: 'gbp_not_connected' \| 'rate_limited', next_allowed_at } }`; **402** `{ reason: insufficient_tokens, balance, cost, costs_by_type }` (13a) |
| 26 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/refresh` | user, owner | – | Button state: `{ frequency, gbp_connected, next_refresh_at, last_auto_refresh_at, rankings: { next_allowed_at, active_run }, gbp: { next_allowed_at, active_sync, last_synced_at } \| null, report: { pending, scheduled_for, last_generated_at }, tokens: { cost: { rankings, gbp }, balance } }` |
| 27 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/gbp/sync` | user, owner | query `syncId?` (24-hex) | `{ gbp_connected, sync: { sync_id, status, trigger, backfill, run_at, started_at, finished_at, duration_ms, types, api_calls, failure_reason } \| null, last_synced_at }` |

**Notes:**
- **#25:** **429** only when every requested type is rate-limited; the body still has `next_allowed_at` per type, so the button can say when it's available again. An in-progress run or sync is returned (`existing: true`) without using the limit. **400** for an unknown type; **422** if the rank run is over the call cap.
- **#25 (7c):** a refresh that queues something also marks competitor Place Details for refetch in the next GBP report (facts older than 24 h).
- **#26:** `next_allowed_at` is `null` when the type can be refreshed now. `report` (7c): `pending` while a GBP report generation is scheduled.
- **#27:** `types` has one entry per data type (`performance`, `keywords`, `profile`, `verification`, `reviews`, `media`, `posts`), each `{ status: pending | ok | error | not_available | skipped, message, rows, range }`. Reviews, media and posts are `not_available` (`v4_access_pending`) until Google approves v4 access. Sync `status`: `queued`, `running`, `done`, `partial` (some types failed) or `failed`.

### GBP report (Phase 7c)

Generated in the `gbp-report` job about 2 minutes after a rank run or GBP sync finishes (one report when both finish together), after a change of tracked competitors, and after an unbind. GET only reads it.

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Params | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 28 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/gbp/report` | user, owner | query `range` (`28d` default, `90d`, `12m`) | `{ location_id, generated_at, trigger, gbp_connected, v4_enabled, range, gbp_score, performance, keywords, reviews, media, posts, pending_google_edits, verification, competitors: { rows (12.5: + `photo_count`, `photos_capped`, `reviews`, `recent_review_at`), insights, warning }, sync, score_history, api_calls, inputs, generation, attribution }` |

**Notes:**
- **#28:** **404** before the first report; **400** for another `range`. A section that can't be shown is `{ available: false, reason }`: `gbp_not_connected` (every private section of a location added via Places search; the competitor comparison still works), `v4_access_pending` (reviews, media, posts; the GBP Score then excludes those pillars with `partial: true`), `not_synced_yet`, `no_place_id`. Shapes and examples: [API.md](API.md#gbp-report-phase-7c).

### Auth, organization, locations and clients (Phase 8)

Every location, client and report belongs to an organization; roles `owner`, `member`, `client_user` (see Conventions). Shapes and examples: [API.md](API.md#auth-organizations-locations-and-clients-phase-8).

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Params / body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 29 | POST | `/auth/signup` | none | `{ account_type: business\|agency, name, email, password, organization_name, country: US\|CA, accept_terms: true }` | **201** `{ user_id, organization_id, email_verification, verify_before }` |
| 30 | POST | `/auth/verify-email` | none | `{ token }` | First time: `{ verified, already_verified: false, tokens, user, organizations, current_organization_id, onboarding }`; then `{ verified: true, already_verified: true }`; **400** `link_expired` / `link_invalid` |
| 31 | POST | `/auth/resend-verification` | none | `{ email }` | `{ email_verification: 'sent_if_pending' }` |
| 32 | POST | `/auth/login` | none | `{ email, password }` | Session; **403** `email_not_verified` |
| 33 | POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | none | `{ email }` | `{ reset: 'sent_if_account_exists' }` |
| 34 | POST | `/auth/reset-password` | none | `{ token, password, confirm_password }` (password rules as signup) | `{ reset: true }` (sessions revoked, email verified); **400** `link_invalid` (unknown, replaced or used), `link_expired`, `passwords_do_not_match` |
| 35 | GET | `/organization` | user + org | – | `{ organization, role, memberships }` |
| 36 | PATCH | `/organization` | user + org (owner) | `{ name?, country? }` | As #35 |
| 37 | GET | `/organization/usage` | user + org | – | `{ plan: { id, name, kind }, billing: { state, read_only, trial_ends_at, current_period_end }, locations: { used, limit, max }, users: { used, limit }, tokens: { balance }, keywords: { used, limit: null }, clients, api_usage: { … } }` (13a; `api_usage` 12.5) |
| 38 | GET | `/organization/members` | user + org (owner/member) | – | `[{ user_id, name, email, role, client_ids, status }]` |
| 39 | GET | `/locations` | user + org | `search, client_id, status, sort, order, page, limit` | `{ locations: [row], page, limit, total }` |
| 40 | POST | `/locations` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ place_id, client_id? }` | **201** `{ location, api_calls }`; **409** `duplicate_place`; 13a: **402** `subscription_required` (trial allowance used / read-only), **402** `location_payment_required` `{ used, paid, quote }`, **403** `enterprise_required` `{ used, max }` |
| 41 | GET | `/locations/:locationId` | user, owner | – | Location header |
| 42 | GET | `/locations/:locationId/overview` | user, owner | – | Header + `rankings, gbp, performance, reviews, competitors, refresh, empty_states` |
| 43 | PATCH | `/locations/:locationId` | user, owner (write) | `{ name?, timezone?, client_id? }` | Header |
| 44 | DELETE | `/locations/:locationId` | user, owner (write) | – | `{ deleted, gbp_unbound, jobs_cancelled, usage }` |
| 45 | GET | `/clients` | user + org (agency) | `search, status, page, limit` (limit 1–100) | `{ clients, page, limit, total }` |
| 46 | POST | `/clients` | user + org (agency, owner/member) | `{ name, website?, contact_email? }` | **201** client |
| 47 | GET | `/clients/:clientId` | user + org (agency) | – | `{ client, locations, summary }` |
| 48 | PATCH | `/clients/:clientId` | user + org (agency, owner/member) | `{ name?, website?, contact_email?, status? }` | Client |
| 49 | DELETE | `/clients/:clientId` | user + org (agency, owner/member) | – | `{ deleted, locations_unassigned }` |
| 50 | POST | `/clients/:clientId/locations` | user + org (agency, owner/member) | `{ location_id }` | `{ assigned, client_id, location_id }` |
| 51 | DELETE | `/clients/:clientId/locations/:locationId` | user + org (agency, owner/member) | – | `{ unassigned, client_id, location_id }` |
| 52 | POST | `/onboarding/skip` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ step: google\|reporting_brand }` | As #17 |

| 53 | GET | `/dashboard` | user + org | `page, limit, sort (name\|client\|rank\|rank_change\|gbp_score), order` | Business: `{ type, locations_count, visibility, gbp, reviews, citations (16), movement, key_competitor, recommended_actions, refresh, status_counts, locations }`; Agency: `{ type, clients_count, locations_count, portfolio (+ avg_citation_score), citations (16), status_counts, declines, gbp_issues, recommended_actions, table (rows + citations) }` |
| 54 | POST | `/organization/invitations` | user + org (owner) | `{ email, role: member\|client_user, client_ids? }` | **201** `{ invitation_id, email, role, client_ids, status, expires_at, email_sent }`; **409** `already_member`; 13a: **403** `user_limit_reached` `{ used, limit }` (users = 3 per paid location, pooled; pending invitations count) |
| 55 | GET | `/organization/invitations` | user + org (owner) | `status?` | `[{ invitation_id, email, role, client_ids, status, expires_at, invited_by, created_at }]` |
| 56 | DELETE | `/organization/invitations/:invitationId` | user + org (owner) | – | `{ revoked, invitation_id }` |
| 57 | PATCH | `/organization/members/:userId` | user + org (owner) | `{ role, client_ids? }` | `{ user_id, role, client_ids }`; **403** `owner_protected` |
| 58 | DELETE | `/organization/members/:userId` | user + org (owner) | – | `{ removed, user_id }`; **403** `owner_protected` |
| 59 | POST | `/auth/invitations/inspect` | none | `{ token }` | `{ organization, email, role, status, expires_at, account_exists }`; **404** unknown; **410** `expired` / `revoked` / `accepted` |
| 60 | POST | `/auth/invitations/accept` | none | `{ token, name?, password? }` | New account: `{ accepted, organization_id, login_required: false, tokens, user, organizations, … }`; existing: `{ accepted, organization_id, login_required: true }` |

**Notes:**
- **#53:** reads only the stored per-location summaries (no rank-run or report documents, no Google). A client_user gets the agency shape for its clients only.
- **#54–#60:** the invitation token (32 random bytes) is stored as a SHA-256 hash, valid `INVITATION_TTL_DAYS` (7), single use, and travels in the request body (never a URL path). In development no email is sent: the link is logged with the email masked.
- **#17 (Phase 8):** `GET /onboarding/state` now returns `organization` (steps, `next_step`, `completed`) and `empty_states` before `gbp` and `locations`; every location of the organization is listed (unfinished first) with `source` and `client_id`.
- **#21 (Phase 8):** without `locationId` it is the add-location search (`country` or the organization's).
- **#22 (Phase 8):** no GBP binding needed; the GBP sync is queued only when bound.
- **#29–#34:** verification and reset are one-time links (no codes): tokens stored hashed, single use (verification 24 h, reset 60 min); rate-limited per email (and IP) with **429** `rate_limited`.
- **#40:** 1 Place Details call (US/CA only), after the limit and duplicate checks.
- **#44:** soft delete; history is kept and the plan slot freed at once.

### Reports center (Phase 12)

A report freezes stored data (rank runs, the GBP report, the profile snapshot) and the organization's branding in a snapshot, and its PDF is rendered once (PDFKit, no browser). Shapes and examples: [API.md](API.md#reports-center-phase-12).

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Params / body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 61 | POST | `/reports` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ location_id, type: rank_tracker\|gbp_audit\|competitor_analysis\|citation (16)\|full, sections?, run_id?, range?: 28d\|90d\|12m }` | **202** report view with `existing`; **400** `invalid_section`, `no_rank_run`, `gbp_not_connected`, `no_gbp_report`, `no_citations_yet` (16), `no_data` |
| 62 | GET | `/reports` | user + org | `location_id, client_id, type, status (queued\|generating\|ready\|failed\|expired\|archived), page, limit` | `{ reports: [view], page, limit, total }`; each view has `run_id` and `run_at` (17: the rank run's date) |
| 63 | GET | `/reports/:reportId` | user + org | – | `{ report, snapshot: { location, data, sources } \| null, document: { title, period, generated_at, branding, blocks } \| null }` |
| 64 | GET | `/reports/:reportId/pdf` | user + org | – | `application/pdf` attachment; **409** `not_ready` / `expired` |
| 65 | DELETE | `/reports/:reportId` | user + org (owner/member) | – | `{ archived, report_id }` |
| 66 | POST | `/reports/:reportId/email` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ recipients: [email] (1–10), message? }` | `{ sent, recipients, delivery: attachment\|link }`; **429** `rate_limited` |
| 67 | POST | `/reports/:reportId/share` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ expires_in_days?: 1–365 \| null }` | **201** `{ share_id, url, expires_at }`; **409** unless ready and unarchived |
| 68 | GET | `/reports/:reportId/shares` | user + org (owner/member) | – | `[{ share_id, purpose, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at, active, views, last_viewed_at }]` |
| 69 | DELETE | `/reports/:reportId/shares/:shareId` | user + org (owner/member) | – | `{ revoked, share_id }` |
| 70 | POST | `/report-schedules` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ scope: location\|client, location_id \| client_id, type, sections?, range?, recipients (1–10) }` | **201** schedule view; **400** `manual_only`, `gbp_not_connected`; **403** `agency_only` (client scope) |
| 71 | GET | `/report-schedules` | user + org | `location_id, client_id, status` | `[schedule view]` |
| 72 | GET | `/report-schedules/:scheduleId` | user + org | – | `{ schedule_id, scope, location_id, client_id, type, sections, range, recipients, frequency, status, locations, next_expected, last_sent_at, last_error, last_report_id, created_at }` |
| 73 | PATCH | `/report-schedules/:scheduleId` | user + org (owner/member) | `{ type?, sections?, range?, recipients?, status?: active\|paused }` | schedule view |
| 74 | DELETE | `/report-schedules/:scheduleId` | user + org (owner/member) | – | `{ deleted, schedule_id }` |
| 75 | GET | `/organization/branding` | user + org | – | `{ white_label, name, agency_name, primary_color, secondary_color, footer_text, contact_text, hide_mypageseo, email_sender_name, email_reply_to, logo: { mime, bytes, url } \| null, updated_at }` |
| 76 | PUT | `/organization/branding` | user + org (owner, agency) | any of `agency_name, primary_color (#rrggbb), secondary_color, footer_text, contact_text, hide_mypageseo, email_sender_name, email_reply_to` (`""` clears) | as #75; **403** `agency_only` / `owner_only` |
| 77 | GET | `/organization/branding/logo` | user + org | – | the image; **404** without a logo |
| 78 | PUT | `/organization/branding/logo` | user + org (owner, agency) | `{ data: "data:image/png;base64,…" }` | as #75; **400** `logo_type`, `logo_too_large` |
| 79 | DELETE | `/organization/branding/logo` | user + org (owner, agency) | – | as #75 |

Public share links (outside `/api/v1`, no login):

| # | Method | Public path | Auth | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | GET | `/r/:token` | share token | Branded HTML (no scripts, CSP `default-src 'none'`, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, no internal ids); the same **404** page for an unknown, revoked, expired or archived link; **429** above 60 requests / minute per IP |
| 81 | GET | `/r/:token/pdf` | share token | `application/pdf` attachment (views are counted on #80 only) |

**Notes:**
- **#61:** one active (queued / generating) report per location and type: a second request returns it with `existing: true`. A report stuck for 30 minutes is marked failed. `run_id` pins a rank run (default: the latest done/partial). A Full report includes each part that exists; a missing one (e.g. GBP not connected) is an "unavailable" block.
- **GBP v4:** reviews, photos and posts say "Not available yet: this needs Google My Business v4 access" until `GBP_V4_ENABLED`; never sample data.
- **#63:** the snapshot is written once; later rank runs, GBP reports or branding changes never alter a generated report.
- **#66:** in development nothing is sent (`sent: false`); the delivery is logged with the recipients masked.
- **#67:** the token (32 random bytes) is stored as a SHA-256 hash and returned only in this response. The request log redacts `/r/<token>`.
- **#70:** a schedule fires once per monthly automatic refresh of each covered location, after that location's GBP report is generated (job `report-schedule-dispatch`); the report is emailed when ready (job `report-email`). Manual refreshes don't fire schedules. `next_expected` is the next monthly refresh of the covered location(s).
- **Retention:** reports older than `REPORT_RETENTION_MONTHS` (24) lose their PDF and snapshot (status `expired`, daily job `report-retention`).

### Ranking & data quality (Phase 12.5)

No new endpoints; changed responses (examples in [API.md](API.md#ranking--data-quality-phase-125)):
- **Cells** (#6 rank-tracker, #7 grid): each `byTarget` cell also has `samples` (one value per sample: 1–60, 61 = not in the top 60, null = failed) and `spread`; `rank`/`status` are the median. Older runs have neither field.
- **#8 map-ranking:** `?point=`, and `point` on each keyword list.
- **Attribution:** responses with Google Places content carry `attribution: { provider: "Google", text: "Google Maps" }`: #8, #20, #21, #28, `GET /locations`, `GET /locations/:id/overview`, `GET /dashboard`, `GET /reports/:id`.
- **#37:** `api_usage` (Google API calls per billing SKU from the usage ledger, this and last month).
- **#28 competitor rows:** `photo_count` (0–10; 10 = "10+"), `photos_capped`, `reviews` (up to 5, with `author: { name, uri }`), `recent_review_at`; insights `photos_gap`, `review_freshness`.
- **Reports** (#61): Rank Tracker gains the section `map_ranking`, Competitor Analysis the section `reviews`.

## Removed endpoints

Removed in Phase 8: `GET /locations/google-locations/:name` and `GET /locations/google-locations/details/:placeId` (unauthenticated proxies to the old paid Places API; use `GET /places/search`), and `PUT /locations` (now `PATCH /locations/:locationId`).

Removed in Phase 13a: the legacy plan CRUD (`POST/GET /subscription`, `PUT/DELETE /subscription/:plan_id`), `GET /subscription/plans/country/:country` (→ `GET /pricing`), the guest checkout (`POST /subscription/create-subscription`, `GET /subscription/payment-status`), the prefix coupons (`POST /subscription/coupon/generate`, `POST /subscription/coupon/validate`, `GET /subscription/coupons`), `GET /subscription/payments/all`, `POST /subscription/send-subscription-welcome-mail`, and the Square citation-credit routes (`POST /payments/process-payment`, `GET /payments/plans/list`, `GET /payments/getAllPayments`). Replaced by `/billing`, `/pricing` and the billing admin (Phase 13a D5).

Removed in Phase 16: the 13 legacy `/api/v1/citation/*` routes (manual pricings, aggregators, remove prices, `lists/:location_id`, campaign add / business info / details / all, `locations/campaigns/list/all`, tracker GET / POST, builder, `getAllCitatioList`). They were a paid citation-campaign ordering flow with a SerpAPI "tracker" returning sample data and a stub builder; replaced by the Phase 16 citation endpoints. See [plans/phase-16-citations.md](plans/phase-16-citations.md) §1.

Removed on 2026-10-01: `GET /api/v1/gbp`, `POST /api/v1/gbp/bind`, `GET /api/v1/onboarding/gbp-profiles` and `POST /api/v1/onboarding/select-profile` (replaced by the connect, pick and bind flow, #14–#15a).

Removed in Phase 8.1: `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email/resend` (now `POST /api/v1/auth/resend-verification`) and the legacy `POST /api/v1/user/auth/register` (use `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`).

Removed in the legacy cleanup (Phase 9a): the old ranking routes (`/rank-tracker`, `/local-search-grid`, `/local-map-ranking`), `/gbp-audit`, `/reputation-manager`, the white-label report links and the Search Console connect. See [LEGACY_FEATURES.md](LEGACY_FEATURES.md).
