# Frontend → backend map

For the frontend team (Lovable). Every screen in the roadmap's **§16 Master Screen Inventory** ([product/frontend-roadmap.pdf](product/frontend-roadmap.pdf)) is listed with the backend endpoint(s) behind it and whether the data exists.

**Rule:** build a screen (or a section of one) only when it says **available**. **partial** means part of the data exists; the other parts are listed. **planned (phase N)** means the backend is coming; show an empty state or hide it. **not supported** means **don't build it**: the data won't exist.

Every current endpoint (legacy included) is in [ENDPOINTS.md](ENDPOINTS.md); request and response shapes are in [API.md](API.md).

Status as of 2026-09-29: everything through Phase 13a (billing) is merged and pushed; Phase 13b (built, awaiting merge) adds the `/auth` session and account endpoints, password reset by link, the admin panel backend and support tickets. The call sequences of the core flows are in [FLOWS.md](FLOWS.md). Summary: [PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).

## Notes for the frontend team (Phase 10, 2026-09-27)

**1. Sessions: refresh the access token.**
- Access tokens last **1 day** (they were 7). Refresh tokens last **30 days** (`JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS`).
- On a **401** from any endpoint, call `POST /auth/refresh { refresh_token }` once, **store both returned tokens** (the refresh token rotates), and retry with the new access token.
- If the refresh itself fails (401 expired or revoked, 404 disabled account), clear the tokens and go to login. After 30 days the user always logs in again.
- A password change or reset, or an account deletion, ends every session (the next refresh is 401).
- Exact flow, responses and error messages: [API.md](API.md) "Session tokens and refresh".

**2. Admin panel: admin sign-in only.**
- The admin panel signs in with `POST /admin/auth/login` and sends that **admin** token (12 h) on every admin call. User tokens never work on admin routes, and admin tokens never work on user routes.
- Every admin route is guarded. No token → **401**. A role without the permission → **403** `{ "reason": "forbidden", "permission": "…" }`; hide the menu entries the role can't use.
- Passwords by link (13b; no codes anywhere): one admin page **`/reset-password?token=…`** (on `ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL`) posts `POST /admin/auth/reset-password`. It is reached from forgot password (`POST /admin/auth/forgot-password`) and from the welcome email of a new admin (set the first password). See API.md "Platform admin authentication".
- Admin accounts: `/admin/admins` (list, create, edit, deactivate, resend the password link); your own account: `GET /admin/auth/me`, `POST /admin/auth/change-password`.

| Permission | Roles | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| `admins.manage` | super admin | `/admin/admins` (list, create, detail, edit / deactivate, password link), `GET /admin/roles` (read-only role list for the role picker) |
| `platform.read` | super admin, admin | `GET /admin/overview`, `GET /admin/users[/:userId]`, `GET /admin/organizations[/:organizationId]` (13b); `GET /contact-us/get`, `GET /contact-us/:contactId` |
| `platform.write` | super admin, admin | users: disable / enable / sign out everywhere / resend verification / mark verified; organizations: suspend / unsuspend, trial, limit overrides (13b); `PUT /contact-us/:contactId/status`, `DELETE /contact-us/:contactId` |
| `support.read` / `support.manage` | super admin, admin, editor | `/admin/support/tickets*` (13b): the ticket queue, counts, threads, replies and internal notes, status / priority / assignee |
| `content.manage` | super admin, admin, editor | blog, blog categories and FAQs create / update / delete; `POST/PUT /business-categories` |
| `citations.view` / `citations.manage` | super admin, admin, editor | Phase 16 citation admin (directories, per-location lists, work queue) |
| `billing.read` / `billing.manage` | super admin, admin | Phase 13a billing admin `/admin/billing/*`: prices, custom plans, subscriptions, invoices, tokens, packs, coupons, audit log |

The full per-route list is in [ENDPOINTS.md](ENDPOINTS.md) (auth column `admin (permission)`). The public admin routes are `/admin/auth/{login, forgot-password, reset-password}` (rate-limited).

**3. CORS: register every frontend origin.** The wildcard CORS header is gone. The API answers cross-origin requests only from the origins listed in **`ACCESSDOMAINS`** (comma-separated, exact scheme + host + port, e.g. `https://app.mypageseo.com,https://admin.mypageseo.com`). A new frontend URL (staging, preview, admin panel) must be added there, and the API restarted, before it can call the API. Otherwise the browser blocks the request with a CORS error.

**4. Billing (Phase 13a, 2026-09-28).**
- **Read-only organizations:** after the trial (7 days) without a subscription, after a failed payment's 7-day grace, or with an overdue invoice past grace, money-costing actions answer **402** `{ reason: "subscription_required", billing: { state, trial_ends_at } }` (list in ENDPOINTS.md "Billing gates"). Show a banner linking to the billing page; reads keep working. Show `state` / `trial_ends_at` / `grace_ends_at` from `GET /billing`.
- **Suspended organizations** (by a platform admin, 13c): money-costing actions, adding locations and invitations answer **403** `{ reason: "organization_suspended" }`; reads keep working. Show "This account is suspended, contact support" (no billing call to action: **402** is only for payment situations).
- **Adding a location** beyond the paid quantity answers **402** `location_payment_required` with a `quote`: show it, call `POST /billing/location-slots`, send the user to `approve_url`, capture on return, then retry the add. **403** `enterprise_required` above the plan cap (20): show "contact us".
- **Invitations** over the user limit (3 per paid location) answer **403** `user_limit_reached`.
- **Checkout quantity (13c):** `POST /billing/checkout { quantity }` subscribes for that many locations at once (1 to 20, at least the active ones). Ask how many locations the user wants before sending them to PayPal: one approval covers them all.
- **PayPal returns** to `FRONTEND_URL/settings/billing?...`: `checkout=success` → `POST /billing/sync`; `order=return&token=<id>` → `POST /billing/orders/<id>/capture`; `checkout=cancelled` / `order=cancelled` → show nothing.

## Auth

| Screen | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Login | `POST /auth/login` (returns organizations + onboarding), `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout` | **available (8)**. |
| Signup | `POST /auth/signup` (Business or Agency, user details, organization name, country, terms) | **available (8, 8.1)**: creates the user, the organization and the owner membership, and emails a **verification link**. Then show "Check your email" with a resend button (`POST /auth/resend-verification`). Unverified accounts are deleted after 24 h. |
| Forgot password | `POST /auth/forgot-password { email }` | **available (8; link since 13b)**: emails a link to `/reset-password?token=…` (60 minutes, single use; a newer link replaces older ones); same answer whether or not the account exists |
| Reset password (`/reset-password?token=…`) | `POST /auth/reset-password { token, password, confirm_password }` | **available (13b)**: the page the email link opens. Show the password rules; on **400** `link_expired` or `link_invalid` offer "send a new link" (back to forgot password); `passwords_do_not_match` under the confirm field. Success signs out every session and marks the email verified → go to login. Changing the password while logged in: `POST /auth/change-password`. |
| Verify email (`/verify-email?token=…`) | `POST /auth/verify-email { token }`, `POST /auth/resend-verification { email }` | **available (8.1)**: the page the email link opens. Call verify once on load. The first time it logs the user in (continue to onboarding); `already_verified` → "already verified" + Log in (no error page); `link_expired` / `link_invalid` → "Send a new link". Login before verifying is **403** `email_not_verified` (offer resend). Full table: API.md "The `/verify-email` page". |
