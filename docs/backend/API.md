# API: ranking (Phase 5), GBP connection (Phase 6), onboarding (Phase 7a)

The endpoints behind the three ranking pages: **Rank Tracker**, **Local Search Grid** and **Local Map Ranking**. The example responses below are real responses from the demo data (`npm run seed:rank-demo`), with long arrays shortened (`"…"`).

**Try it locally:**
1. Run `npm run seed:rank-demo`. It prints a demo login, an access token and the location id.
2. Run `npm run dev`.
3. Call the endpoints with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

The demo data comes from an offline client, so it needs no API key.

## Conventions

- **Base URL:** `/api/v1/locations/:locationId`.
- **Auth:** every endpoint needs a user access token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`), and the location must belong to that user (`created_by`).

**Error statuses**

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 401 | No token |
| 404 | Someone else's location, or a deleted or inactive one |
| 400 | Malformed `locationId` |

**Envelope:** every response is `{ success, status, message, data }`. For errors, `data` carries the machine-readable details when there are any: `{ "reason": "…", …extra fields }` (e.g. `{ "reason": "location_payment_required", "quote": {…} }`). Build UI states on `data.reason`, never on `message`. Errors without a reason (plain validation failures, unknown routes, 500s) have `data: ""`.

**Targets** are keyed `self` (the client) and `competitor_1`…`competitor_5`, in the order of `tracking.competitors`. The mapping for a run is in `targets`.

**Rank cell** (`CellView`): `{ rank, status, bucket, display }`

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `status` | `ok` (rank 1–60), `not_found` (not in the top 60, shown as `"60+"`), `error` (the search failed after one retry) |
| `bucket` | `pack` (1–3), `visible` (4–10), `low` (11–20), `invisible` (21–60), `not_found`, `error` |
| `display` | `"1"`…`"60"`, `"60+"` or `"error"`; use it directly in the UI |

**Averages**
- `avgRank` counts `not_found` as **61** and **excludes errors**, rounded to 1 decimal.
- `foundRate` and `top3Rate` are shares of the non-error points, rounded to 2 decimals.
- A metric is `null` when every point failed.

**Change** is `previous − current`, so a positive number means improved.
- `changeLabel` is one of: `improved`, `declined`, `unchanged`, `entered_top_60` or `dropped_out_of_top_60`. For the two "top 60" labels, `change` is `null`.
- **Across keyword edits (Phase 17):** the previous run is the latest finished one, whatever its `keywords_version`. A keyword is compared when both runs have it; a newly added keyword has `change: null`. Competitors are matched by place, so a replaced competitor has no change.
- **Overall:** `overall[target].change` compares only the keywords both runs measured; `comparable_keywords` says how many (`keywords_total` = the run's keywords). Show e.g. "+2.1 (on 3 of 5 keywords)" when they differ, and no change when `comparable_keywords` is 0.
- Edited keywords appear from the next run (monthly or a manual refresh), and in reports generated from that run.
- At keyword level, `entered_top_60` means the business was not found at any point last run and is found somewhere now; `dropped_out_of_top_60` is the reverse (CLAUDE.md §4).

**Run status:** `queued` → `running` → `done` | `partial` (some searches failed) | `failed`. Only `done` and `partial` runs have reports.

**Page endpoints** (`rank-tracker`, `grid`, `map-ranking`) show the **latest done or partial run**. Pass `?runId=` to view an older one.
- **404** `{ "reason": "no_completed_run" }` before the first run finishes (show "Your first ranking run is in progress"; a location that isn't yours is a 404 **without** a reason).
- **404** `{ "reason": "run_not_found" }` for an unknown `runId`; **409** `{ "reason": "run_not_finished", "status": "queued" | "running" | "failed" }` for a run that is not done or partial.
- **404** `{ "reason": "keyword_not_in_run" }` for a `keyword` the run doesn't have; map-ranking: **404** `{ "reason": "point_not_in_run", "available": ["C", …] }`.

**`RunMeta`** (the `run` field on page responses): `{ run_id, run_at, status, keywords_version, center: { lat, lng, source, label }, config: { grid_size, spacing_km, radius_km (17), tracker_offset_km, radius_m, store_place_names } }`. `radius_m` is the search bias around each point (5 km), not the grid radius. `center.source` (2026-10-01, frozen with the run; `null` on older runs): `place` = the business's own Google Maps position, `label` its address; `manual` = a city / ZIP chosen at setup, `label` what was picked. Show e.g. "Measured around: your Google Maps pin, 100 Queen St E" or "Measured around: Tampa, FL (set during setup)".

**Estimate** (`CallEstimate`, returned by several endpoints):
- `idsOnly`: free Text Search IDs-only calls, as `{ min, max, maxWithRetries }`
- `pro`: one names search per keyword
- `details`: 1 if the location's coordinates still need resolving
- In development, runs are limited to `RANK_DEV_MAX_KEYWORDS` keywords and a 3×3 grid, reported as `dev_capped: true`.

## Tracking settings

### `GET /tracking`

Returns the location's ranking settings, with defaults filled in, and what a run would cost now.

```json

      },

        "min": 28,

        "maxWithRetries": 160
      }
    },
    "dev_capped": true
  }
}
```

### `PUT /tracking`

Partial update: only the fields you send change.

```json
{
  "keywords": ["Emergency Plumber", "Drain Cleaning", "Water Heater Repair"],
  "competitors": ["ChIJdemoQueenWestPlumbing02", "ChIJdemoDanforthDrainPros03"],
  "grid": { "size": 7, "radius_km": 8 },
  "frequency": "auto_monthly"
}
```

**Rules**
- **`keywords`:** 1 to `RANK_MAX_KEYWORDS` (20) entries of 2–80 characters each. They are trimmed and de-duplicated case-insensitively, and the first spelling is kept.
- **`keywords_version`:** goes up **only when the set of keywords changes**. Reordering or re-casing does not bump it. Changes are still compared on the keywords both runs share (Phase 17).
- **`competitors`:** up to 5 Google place IDs, never the location's own `place_id`. Errors: **400** `too_many_competitors` (+ `limit: 5`), `own_place_id`, `invalid_place_id`.
- **Competitor details (Phase 17):** the response (and `GET /tracking`) has a top-level `competitors: [{ place_id, name, address, lat, lng }]` in the order of `tracking.competitors` (which stays a list of place IDs, as sent). When competitors are saved, each new one gets its details from the competitor suggestions or the latest Map Ranking lists (free), otherwise from one Place Details call (counted in the daily Places limit). If that fails (no key, daily limit, Google error) the fields are `null` and the save still succeeds; they fill in on a later save or when the business shows in a Map Ranking list. Every run stores the names in `targets: [{ key, place_id, name }]`, so the ranking pages label `competitor_1`… without another call.
- **`grid`** (Phase 17): `size` 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 or 13, plus **either** `radius_km` (center to edge, 0.5–15) **or** `spacing_km` (between neighbouring points, 0.1–15). The other is derived (spacing = radius ÷ ((size − 1) / 2)) and both must stay in range, so a 13×13 needs a radius of at least 0.6 km. The response carries all three. New locations start at `{ size: 7, radius_km: 8 }` (about 5 miles). The Rank Tracker and Map Ranking points sit halfway to the edge (radius ÷ 2, at least 0.5 km); the search bias around each point stays 5 km. Error: **400** `{ "reason": "invalid_grid" }`.
- **Cost of a bigger grid:** grid searches use the free IDs-only SKU, so a bigger grid costs run time, not money: at 20 keywords and 3 samples, about 32 min for 9×9, 47 min for 11×11 and 65 min for 13×13. `over_cap: true` means a run with these settings would be refused (422); check it with `GET /tracking/estimate` before saving.
- **`frequency`** (7b): `auto_monthly` (default: the location refreshes automatically once a month, on the day it completed setup, at about 03:00 local) or `manual_only` (only `POST /refresh` or "run now"). `next_run_at` is no longer accepted (400).

**Response 200**

`keywords_version_bumped` is `true` only when the version went up.

**Response 400** (validation):

  "data": { "reason": "invalid_grid", "radius_km": 0.5, "spacing_km": 0.083 }
}
```

### `GET /tracking/estimate` (Phase 17)

What a run would need with a grid and keyword count, **before** saving them (the grid picker). No Google calls, nothing saved. Query (each optional, defaulting to the saved settings): `size`, `radius_km` **or** `spacing_km`, `keywords` (a count). With only `size`, the saved radius is kept.

`GET /locations/:locationId/tracking/estimate?size=13&radius_km=15&keywords=20`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Completed Successfully.",
  "data": {
    "grid": { "size": 13, "spacing_km": 2.5, "radius_km": 15 },
    "keywords": 20,
    "points_per_keyword": 169,
    "tracker_offset_km": 7.5,
    "estimate": { "keywords": 20, "gridSize": 13, "points": 169, "samples": 3, "mapPoints": 5, "idsOnly": { "min": 10140, "max": 30420, "maxWithRetries": 60840 }, "pro": { "min": 100, "max": 100, "maxWithRetries": 200 }, "details": { "min": 0, "max": 0, "maxWithRetries": 0 }, "total": { "min": 10240, "max": 30520, "maxWithRetries": 61040 } },
    "expected_duration_ms": 3815000,
    "cap": 40000,
    "over_cap": false,
    "dev_capped": false,
    "token_cost": { "rankings": 1 }
  }
}
```

- `token_cost.rankings`: what a manual refresh / "run now" costs; it is the same for every grid (Mohit, 2026-10-01).
- `expected_duration_ms`: at `PLACES_MAX_QPS` (8/s), shared by every run on the server.
- In development `dev_capped` is true and the grid is 3×3.
- **400** `{ "reason": "invalid_grid" }` as for `PUT /tracking`.

---

## Runs

### `POST /rank-runs`

"Run now". Queues a run and returns immediately. The run takes about a minute in the background, depending on the number of keywords and the grid size.
- If a run is already queued or running for this location, that run is returned with `existing: true`, and no second run is created.
- **400:** the location has no `place_id`, no tracking keywords, or is not in the US or Canada.
- **422:** the estimated maximum IDs-only calls exceed `RANK_MAX_CALLS_PER_RUN` (default 40,000 since Phase 17). The response includes the estimate.

**Response 202** (a new run; this one is from development, so it is capped to 2 keywords and 3×3):

### `GET /rank-runs?page=&limit=`

## Explicit statuses and scopes on the ranking pages (2026-10-08)

Mohit (2026-10-08): no number may leave the user guessing. Additive fields; nothing was removed.

**Every average says what it is.** Each per-target summary on `GET /rank-tracker` (`keywords[].summary`, `groups[].summary`), on `GET /grid` (`keywords[].summary`), and `overall[target]`, gains:
- `status`:
  - `ok`: a real average.
  - `not_found`: Google answered, but the business wasn't in the top 60 at any point. Show "Not in the top 60" / "60+".
  - `no_data`: every search failed, so we couldn't get results. Show "No data", never 60+.
- `display`: the text to print: `"12.4"`, `"60+"` or `"No data"`.
- `status_text` (on both responses): `{ ok | not_found | no_data: { label, tooltip } }`, the wording for headings and tooltips.

`trend[]` entries on `GET /rank-tracker` gain `status` and `display` too.

**Every page says what it measured.** `scope`:
- `GET /rank-tracker`: `{ kind: "tracker", points: 5, offset_km, description }`, e.g. "5 points: 100 Queen St E and 1.5 km north, south, east and west of it".
- `GET /grid`: `{ kind: "grid", points, size, radius_km, description }`, e.g. "7×7 grid (49 points) within 8 km of 100 Queen St E".
- `GET /map-ranking`, on each `keywords[]`: `{ kind: "point", point, list_depth: 20, description }`, e.g. "Google's top 20 at 100 Queen St E" or "Google's top 20 1.5 km north of 100 Queen St E".

**Map Ranking shows both of the client's numbers at that point.** Each `keywords[]` gains `self: { in_list, list_rank, list_depth: 20, tracker_cell }`.
- `list_rank` is the client's place in this named top 20 (`null` when it's not in the list: "not in the top 20 here").
- `tracker_cell` is the Rank Tracker cell at the same point: `{ rank, status, bucket, display }`.
- They come from separate Google searches, so they can differ by a place or two. Show both, labelled.

**Locations, overview and dashboard:**
- `GET /locations` rows: `rank.status` and `rank.display`.
- `GET /locations/:id/overview` → `rankings.overall_status`, `overall_display`, and `trend[].status`.
- `GET /dashboard`: business `locations[].avg_rank_status` / `avg_rank_display`; agency rows `visibility.avg_rank_status` / `avg_rank_display`.
- `key_competitor` gains `status` and `self_status`.
- No "competitor ahead" action is raised while the client's average is `no_data`.
- `null` status = no run yet.

## Rank Tracker page

### `GET /rank-tracker?runId=`

For each keyword: a summary per target (average rank, found rate, top-3 rate, change) and the 5 sample points. The points are the center `C` plus `N`, `S`, `E` and `W` at `tracker_offset_km`. The response also has `overall` per target and `trend`: the overall average of `self` over the last 12 done or partial runs, oldest first.

**Keyword groups (Phase 17):** `?group=<group_id>` limits `keywords` to that group (`group: { group_id, name }` in the response, `null` without a filter; **404** `group_not_found`). `groups` always lists every group with its summary for this run; see [Keyword groups](#keyword-groups-phase-17). `GET /grid` takes the same `?group=`.

## Local Search Grid page

### `GET /grid?keyword=&runId=`

The heatmap: `size × size` points in row-major order. Row 0 is the northernmost row and col 0 the westernmost column, and the center point is `(size-1)/2, (size-1)/2`.
- Without `keyword`, every keyword is returned.
- An unknown keyword returns 404.
- The example is the demo's "Water Heater Repair": the north-west corner is an `error` cell, and the other corners are `60+`.

## Local Map Ranking page

### `GET /map-ranking?keyword=&runId=&resolveNames=`

"Who ranks at your location": the top 20 at the location center, per keyword. The client is marked `is_self: true`, and tracked competitors have their `target_key`.

**Names**
- **`STORE_PLACE_NAMES=true` (the default):** names are stored with the run and returned here.
- **`STORE_PLACE_NAMES=false`:** `name` is `null` and `names_stored` is `false`.
  - `?resolveNames=true` looks the names up live, costing up to 20 Place Details calls per request, and needs the API key (503 without it).
  - This mode is pending a ToS decision (see STATUS.md).

**Map pins (Phase 17):** each result has `address`, `lat` and `lng`, so the page can show the 20 businesses on a map (the client's pin from `is_self`, competitors' from `target_key`). They come from the same Map Ranking search (Text Search Pro fields, no extra cost) and are stored under the same `STORE_PLACE_NAMES` switch as the names. Runs before Phase 17 answer `null` for all three: hide the map for them.

## Keyword groups (Phase 17)

Named sets of a location's tracked keywords (e.g. "Emergency", "Water heaters") for filtering the Rank Tracker and grid pages and for group summaries. A keyword can be in several groups or none. Up to 20 groups per location; groups are free (no tokens, no Google calls) and don't change `keywords_version`. Removing a keyword from tracking (`PUT /tracking`) removes it from its groups. Owner and member can edit; a client user can read.

| Call | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /locations/:locationId/keyword-groups` | | `{ groups: [{ group_id, name, keywords }], limit: 20 }` (`keywords` in the tracked spelling) |
| `POST /locations/:locationId/keyword-groups` | `{ name (1–60), keywords: ["…"] }` (at least 1, all tracked; case and spacing ignored) | **201** `{ group_id, name, keywords }` |
| `PATCH /locations/:locationId/keyword-groups/:groupId` | `{ name?, keywords? }` (at least one; `keywords` replaces the list) | the group |
| `DELETE /locations/:locationId/keyword-groups/:groupId` | | `{ deleted: true, group_id }` |

**Errors:** **400** `{ reason: "unknown_keyword", keywords: ["…"] }` (not tracked), **400** `{ reason: "too_many_groups", limit: 20 }`, **409** `group_name_taken` (names are unique per location, ignoring case), **404** `group_not_found`.

**Group summaries** on `GET /rank-tracker` (`groups[]`), per target:

```json
{
  "group_id": "6abe37102faf69393e391b12",
  "name": "Emergency",
  "keywords": ["Emergency Plumber", "24 Hour Plumber"],
  "keywords_in_run": 2,
  "summary": {
    "self": { "avgRank": 6.4, "foundRate": 0.9, "top3Rate": 0.4, "change": 1.5, "comparable_keywords": 2 },
    "competitor_1": { "avgRank": 9, "foundRate": 1, "top3Rate": 0.2, "change": -0.5, "comparable_keywords": 2 }
  }
}
```

- `avgRank`, `foundRate`, `top3Rate`: the means over the group's keywords that this run measured (`keywords` / `keywords_in_run`; a keyword added since the run isn't in it).
- `change`: the mean of those keywords' numeric changes (positive = improved); `comparable_keywords` says how many had one (`entered_top_60` / `dropped_out_of_top_60` and new keywords have none). `null` when none.
- `GET /tracking` returns the stored groups as `tracking.keyword_groups: [{ _id, name, keywords }]` with **normalised** keywords; use `GET /keyword-groups` for display.
- Rank Tracker reports have a `keyword_groups` section (a table: group, keywords, average rank, top-3, change for the client), frozen at generation.

---

## Keyword history (Phase 17)

### `GET /keyword-history?keyword=&limit=`

One tracked keyword across the location's finished runs, oldest first, for the per-keyword chart. `limit` 1–24 (default 12). Runs that didn't measure the keyword (before it was added) are skipped. Each run lists its `targets`, because a competitor slot (`competitor_1`) can hold another business in an older run: match competitors across runs by `place_id`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Completed Successfully.",
  "data": {
    "keyword": "Emergency Plumber",
    "runs": [
      {
        "run_id": "6ab6dc8a10f657b7c9476cff",
        "run_at": "2026-09-01T03:00:00.000Z",
        "status": "done",
        "keywords_version": 1,
        "targets": [{ "key": "self", "place_id": "ChIJdemoMapleLeafPlumbing01", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating" }, { "key": "competitor_1", "place_id": "ChIJdemoQueenWestPlumbing02", "name": "Queen West Plumbing" }],
        "summary": {
          "self": { "avgRank": 8.2, "foundRate": 1, "top3Rate": 0.2, "change": null, "changeLabel": null },
          "competitor_1": { "avgRank": 5, "foundRate": 1, "top3Rate": 0.4, "change": null, "changeLabel": null }
        }
      },
      {
        "run_id": "6abe37102faf69393e391b40",
        "run_at": "2026-10-01T03:00:00.000Z",
        "status": "done",
        "keywords_version": 2,
        "targets": [{ "key": "self", "place_id": "ChIJdemoMapleLeafPlumbing01", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating" }, { "key": "competitor_1", "place_id": "ChIJdemoQueenWestPlumbing02", "name": "Queen West Plumbing" }],
        "summary": {
          "self": { "avgRank": 5.4, "foundRate": 1, "top3Rate": 0.6, "change": 2.8, "changeLabel": "improved" },
          "competitor_1": { "avgRank": 5.2, "foundRate": 1, "top3Rate": 0.4, "change": -0.2, "changeLabel": "declined" }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **404** `{ "reason": "keyword_not_tracked" }` for a keyword the location doesn't track now.
- **Overall history for every target** (the client and each competitor): `GET /rank-runs` (each run's `overall[target]`), or `trend` on `GET /rank-tracker` (the client only, last 12 runs).

---

## Auth errors

**401** without a token:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized : please authenticate.",
  "data": ""
}
```

**404** is returned for another user's location, on every endpoint.

---

## GBP connection (Phase 6)

Setup and a step-by-step local walkthrough are in [GBP_CONNECT.md](GBP_CONNECT.md). The examples below use the hand-written test fixtures (no live GBP calls have been made yet). All routes need a user token, except the OAuth callback, which Google calls.

GBP errors use the same envelope:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | "Please connect with Google Business Profile"; "Reconnect Google Business Profile…" (Google rejected the stored authorisation); invalid input |
| 404 | location not yours, or not bound |
| 409 | the GBP location is already bound to another of your locations |
| 502 | Google failed |
| 503 | GBP API access not approved (quota 0), API not enabled, or server not configured |

"Reconnect" is a 400, not a 401, because a 401 from this API means the MyPageSEO session expired.

### `GET /api/v1/gbp/connect/url`

Starts the connection. `data` is Google's consent URL, with scope `business.manage` only, offline access, and a one-time `state` valid for 10 minutes.

### `GET /api/v1/gbp/connect/callback?code=&state=` (called by Google)

Google sends the **browser** here (the API domain). When it is done, the API redirects the browser back to the web app (2026-09-30):

```
302 → FRONTEND_URL/gbp/connect/callback?status=success&message=Connected%20as%20owner%40example.test
302 → FRONTEND_URL/gbp/connect/callback?status=denied&message=Google%20Business%20Profile%20access%20was%20not%20granted.
302 → FRONTEND_URL/gbp/connect/callback?status=error&message=This%20connection%20link%20is%20invalid%20or%20has%20expired.%20Start%20the%20connection%20again.
```

`message` is always a user-facing sentence (an unexpected failure gives "The Google connection could not be completed. Start it again."). The web app's `/gbp/connect/callback` page shows it. Only when `FRONTEND_URL` is empty (local tools) does the endpoint answer JSON instead:

```json
{ "success": true, "status": 200, "message": "Connected with GBP successfully.",
  "data": { "connected": true, "google_email": "owner@example.test", "google_sub": "100000000000000000001" } }
```

Since Phase 7a, both connect flows request `openid email business.manage` and verify the id_token. The redirect flow also sends `prompt=select_account consent`. A user can connect **several Google accounts** (agencies): each is a *connection*, identified by `google_sub`. Connecting the same account again updates it; a new account is added. The popup flow is in the onboarding section below.

In JSON mode, **400** is returned for an unknown, expired or reused `state` ("This connection link is invalid or has expired. Start the connection again."), and for `error=access_denied` ("Google Business Profile access was not granted.").

### Connected accounts, the connect modal and the Bind button (2026-10-01)

Per user. Flow: connect a Google account (popup) → in the same modal list that account's locations → tick the ones you want → save the selection (**picks**). Only picked locations appear on the locations page, as `pending_gbp` rows with a **Bind** button. Binding creates (or links) our location and is where the subscription applies. Picking is free.

#### `GET /api/v1/gbp/connections`

```json
{
  "limit": 3,
  "connections": [
    {
      "google_sub": "100000000000000000001",
      "google_email": "owner@example.test",
      "status": "active",
      "picked": 2,
      "bound": 1,
      "locations": [{ "location_id": "6abe7a513e25d4bbc0bcaeac", "name": "Example Plumbing Co" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Up to **3 Google accounts per user**. Connecting a 4th answers **409** `{ "reason": "google_account_limit", "limit": 3, "connected": ["…"] }` on `POST /gbp/connect/code` (the new grant is revoked at Google). Connecting an already connected account again just refreshes it.
- `status: "revoked"`: Google refused the stored access; connect the same account again.
- `picked` = picks not bound yet; `bound` = picks bound to a location.
- `locations` (2026-10-01): the locations bound through this account. **Disconnecting deletes them**, so the disconnect dialog names them under the warning "All the data and locations related to this Google account will be removed if disconnected."

#### `GET /api/v1/gbp/connections/:googleSub/locations`

The connect modal's list for one account (Business Information only, no Places calls):

```json
{
  "google_sub": "100000000000000000001",
  "google_email": "owner@example.test",
  "locations": [
    {
      "gbpAccountId": "accounts/100000000000000000001",
      "gbpLocationId": "locations/200000000000000000001",
      "title": "Example Plumbing Co",
      "address": "100 Example St, Suite 5, Dallas, TX 75201",
      "city": "Dallas",
      "region_code": "US",
      "place_id": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001",
      "supported": true,
      "picked": false,
      "picked_by_other": false,
      "pick_id": null,
      "bound_location_id": null
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

- `supported: false` (not US/CA): show it greyed out; it can't be picked.
- `picked_by_other`: another user of the organization picked it (it can't be picked twice).
- `bound_location_id`: already bound; show it as bound, not selectable.
- `errors`: business accounts inside the Google account whose locations could not be listed.
- **404** `google_account_not_connected` for a `googleSub` that isn't one of yours; a connection-wide Google failure (revoked, access not approved) is an error for the whole request.

#### `PUT /api/v1/gbp/connections/:googleSub/picks`

Body: `{ "gbp_location_ids": ["locations/200000000000000000001", "…"] }`: the full selection for that account (send the ticked ids; an empty list clears it).

- New ids are picked; unbound picks left out are removed; bound ones stay (`kept_bound`; unbind them first).
- Returns the same body as the list above, plus `{ "picked": 1, "removed": 0, "kept_bound": 0 }`.
- **400** `unknown_location` (the account doesn't list it) or `unsupported_region` (with `gbp_location_ids`); **409** `picked_by_other`.

#### Picks on the locations page: `GET /api/v1/locations` → `pending_gbp`

`GET /locations` adds `pending_gbp` (the current user's picks not bound yet; outside the table's filters and pagination):

```json
"pending_gbp": [
  { "pick_id": "6702…", "google_sub": "1000…", "google_email": "owner@example.test", "gbpLocationId": "locations/200000000000000000001",
    "title": "Example Plumbing Co", "address": "100 Example St, Suite 5, Dallas, TX 75201", "city": "Dallas", "region_code": "US",
    "place_id": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001", "picked_at": "2026-10-01T10:00:00.000Z", "existing_location_id": null }
]
```

`existing_location_id`: the organization already has a location for this place (e.g. added from a Places search, or unbound earlier): binding links to it and uses no new location slot.

#### `POST /api/v1/gbp/picks/:pickId/bind` (the Bind button)

Body: `{ "client_id"?: "…" }` (optional grouping).

- Reads the profile from Google (1 GBP call); links the organization's location with the same place, or creates one from the profile (name, address, city, state, zip, country, phone, website, category, `place_id`, lat/lng; missing text fields become `"n/a"`).
- **Subscription gate:** read-only organizations answer **402** `subscription_required`; creating a location beyond the paid quantity answers **402** `location_payment_required` with a `quote` (pay for a slot, then press Bind again); beyond the plan's cap **403** `enterprise_required`; a suspended organization **403** `organization_suspended`.
- **409** `already_bound` (with `location_id`), `place_id_mismatch`; **400** "Only US and Canadian businesses are supported."

```json
{
  "pick_id": "6702…",
  "location": { "location_id": "66f5…", "name": "Example Plumbing Co", "address": "100 Example St, Suite 5, Dallas, TX 75201",
                "place_id": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001", "lat": 32.7801, "lng": -96.8005 },
  "created": true,
  "center_needed": false,
  "binding": {
    "binding": { "location_id": "66f5…", "gbpAccountId": "accounts/1000…", "gbpLocationId": "locations/2000…", "title": "Example Plumbing Co", "place_id": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001" },
    "place_id": { "location": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001", "gbp": "ChIJfakeGbpPlace000000001", "status": "set" },
    "coordinates": "set"
  }
}
```

After Bind the location continues the setup: `center_needed: true` (a service-area business) → `PUT /locations/:id/center`, then keywords, competitors and `POST /onboarding/complete`.

#### `DELETE /api/v1/gbp/picks/:pickId`

Removes an unbound pick from the locations page: `{ "removed": true, "pick_id": "…" }`. **409** `already_bound` for a bound one (unbind the location instead).

**`place_id.status`:**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `set` | Our location had none, so it was filled from GBP. |
| `match` | Our location already had the same place ID. |
| `conflict` | Our location has a different place ID. It is kept and never overwritten. |
| `none` | GBP has no place ID. |

**`coordinates`:**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `set` | lat/lng were empty and were filled from GBP. |
| `kept` | Our location already had lat/lng. |
| `none` | GBP has no coordinates. |

### `POST /api/v1/gbp/unbind` (new)

Body: `{ "location_id" }`.

```json
{ "unbound": true, "jobs_cancelled": { "gbp_sync": 0, "scheduled_posts": 1 } }
```

- The location stays (rankings keep working, `gbp_connected: false`) with **status `gbp_disconnected`** and `gbp_disconnected_at` (2026-10-01; a location that never had GBP is `gbp_not_connected`); its pick is removed. Pick the profile again in the connect modal and Bind to reconnect it (it links to the same location, no new slot).
- The Google account stays connected (2026-10-01: disconnecting is explicit, `POST /gbp/disconnect`).
- Cancelled scheduled posts are marked `REJECTED` with `last_error: "GBP location unbound"`.

### `POST /api/v1/gbp/disconnect` (disconnect one Google account)

Body: `{ "google_sub"?: "…" }`. It is required when several Google accounts are connected.

```json
{
  "revoked": true,
  "bindings_removed": 1,
  "picks_removed": 3,
  "google_email": "a@client.test",
  "locations_removed": [{ "location_id": "6abe7a513e25d4bbc0bcaeac", "name": "Example Plumbing Co" }]
}
```

- **Deletes the locations bound through that account** (Mohit, 2026-10-01): each is soft-deleted exactly like `DELETE /locations/:id` (hidden, jobs cancelled, its location slot freed; history kept in the database). Show the warning first: "All the data and locations related to this Google account will be removed if disconnected.", naming `GET /gbp/connections` → `locations`.
- Revokes that account at Google (best effort), removes its picks and deletes its tokens. Other connected accounts and their locations keep working.
- Unbinding one location (`POST /gbp/unbind`) keeps that location instead (status `gbp_disconnected`).
- `revoked: false` means Google could not be reached; the local cleanup still happened.
- `is_gbp_connected` on the user stays true while another usable connection remains.

## Onboarding (Phase 7a)

The first-run flow. The examples use test fixtures; no live calls have been made. The frontend walkthrough, including the Google Identity Services popup code, is in [GBP_CONNECT.md](GBP_CONNECT.md#3-connect-with-the-account-chooser-popup-phase-7a-recommended).

**Screens → endpoints:**

| # | Screen | Endpoint(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Connect Google (popup; up to 3 accounts) | `GET /gbp/connect/popup` → GIS popup → `POST /gbp/connect/code` |
| 2 | Pick your business (in the connect modal), then Bind | `GET /gbp/connections/:googleSub/locations` → `PUT /gbp/connections/:googleSub/picks` → (locations page) `POST /gbp/picks/:pickId/bind` |
| 2b | Business center (only when `center_needed`: service-area businesses) | `PUT /locations/:id/center { query: "city or ZIP" }` |
| 3 | Keywords | `PUT /locations/:id/tracking { keywords }` |
| 4 | Competitors | `GET /locations/:id/competitor-suggestions`, optional `GET /places/search?q=&locationId=`, then `PUT /locations/:id/tracking { competitors }` (an empty list is fine) |
| 5 | Done | `POST /onboarding/complete` |
| – | Resume | `GET /onboarding/state` |

### `GET /api/v1/gbp/connect/popup`

Config for `google.accounts.oauth2.initCodeClient`. The `state` is valid for 10 minutes and works once. `select_account: true` shows the account chooser. The GIS code client has no `prompt` or `access_type` options: the code flow returns a refresh token on first consent, and a reconnect of the same account without one reuses the stored refresh token.

```json
{ "client_id": "….apps.googleusercontent.com", "scope": "openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage",
  "state": "b6ZQ…43 chars", "ux_mode": "popup", "select_account": true }
```

### `POST /api/v1/gbp/connect/code`

Body: `{ "code", "state" }` from the popup callback.

```json
{ "connected": true, "google_email": "owner@example.test", "google_sub": "100000000000000000001" }
```

- The same Google account again updates its connection; another account is **added** as a new connection (no 409).
- **400:** bad, expired or reused state, or another user's state; the Google account could not be verified; a new account without a refresh token.

### `GET /api/v1/onboarding/state`

```json
{
  "gbp": { "connected": true,
           "connections": [{ "google_sub": "100000000000000000001", "google_email": "owner@example.test", "status": "active" }] },
  "locations": [
    { "location_id": "66f5…", "name": "Example Plumbing Co",
      "onboarding": { "step": "keywords_set", "started_at": "2026-09-26T10:00:00.000Z", "completed_at": null } }
  ]
}
```

- `gbp.connections` lists every connected Google account; `status` is `active` or `revoked` (reconnect that account). `connected` is true while any is active.
- `locations` holds only locations created or linked through onboarding, unfinished ones first.
- `step` is one of `profile_selected` → (`center_needed` → `center_set`, service-area businesses only) → `keywords_set` → `competitors_set` → `completed`.

### `PUT /api/v1/locations/:locationId/center` (service-area businesses)

Body, one of:
- `{ "place_id": "ChIJ…", "session": "<the picker's session token>" }` (2026-10-01, **recommended**): a suggestion picked from `GET /places/autocomplete`. **1 Place Details call** (Essentials: `location`, `formattedAddress`) that also ends the autocomplete session; `center_label` is Google's address (e.g. "Tampa, FL, USA"). Counts **1** toward the daily Places limit.
- `{ "query": "Fredericton, NB" }`: a city or ZIP / postal code typed freely, 2–100 characters (the original path, below).

- It is resolved once with **1 Places Text Search (IDs-only, free SKU)** in the location's country (no location bias) and **1 Place Details call for `location` only**.
- The result is saved as the location's lat/lng with `center_source: "manual"`. Rank runs and competitor suggestions use it. Old cached suggestions are dropped.
- The 2 calls count against the daily Places limit.

### `GET /api/v1/places/autocomplete?q=&session=&country=|locationId=` (2026-10-01)

City / region / ZIP suggestions for the setup-center picker, from **Google Places Autocomplete (New)** limited to regions and postal codes (`(regions)`) in the country (the location's with `locationId`, else `country`, else the organization's).

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    { "place_id": "ChIJ4dG5s4K3wogRY7SWr4kTX6c", "description": "Tampa, FL, USA", "main_text": "Tampa", "secondary_text": "FL, USA", "types": ["locality", "political", "geocode"] }
  ],
  "attribution": { "provider": "Google", "text": "Google Maps" }
}
```

- **Session token:** create one per picker (e.g. `crypto.randomUUID()`), send it with every keystroke as `session`, and send the same token with the pick: `PUT /locations/:id/center { place_id, session }`. Google then bills the keystrokes and the pick as one session. Start a new token after a pick.
- **Cost** (Google list prices, 2026-10-01): a session that ends with the pick costs the Place Details Essentials call (**$5 per 1,000**, i.e. $0.005) plus at most its first 12 autocomplete requests at **$2.83 per 1,000** (later ones in the session are free). A typical pick after 3–5 keystrokes is about **$0.013–0.019**; Google's monthly free allowance (10,000 per SKU) usually covers it. An abandoned session bills each keystroke at $2.83 per 1,000. Debounce typing (~250 ms) and start after 2–3 characters.
- **Limits:** keystrokes don't count toward the daily Places limit (the pick counts 1); they are rate-limited to 120 per user per hour (**429** `rate_limited`). `q` 1–100 characters; `session` 8–36 URL-safe characters (**400** otherwise).

```json
{ "lat": 45.9635895, "lng": -66.6431151, "center_source": "manual", "center_label": "Fredericton, NB", "api_calls": 2, "onboarding_step": "center_set" }
```

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid `query`, or the location's country is not US/CA |
| 404 | Nothing found for the query, or the location is not yours |
| 429 | Daily search limit reached |
| 502 | Google failed |

### `PUT /api/v1/locations/:locationId/tracking` (Phase 5, extended)

- Unchanged for normal locations.
- On an onboarding location the response adds `onboarding_step`:
  - Setting keywords moves it to `keywords_set`, except while the step is `center_needed`: keywords are saved but the step waits for the center.
  - Sending `competitors` (even `[]`) moves it to `competitors_set`.
- Steps never go backwards.

### `GET /api/v1/locations/:locationId/competitor-suggestions[?refresh=true]`

- One Places search per tracking keyword at the location's center: 2 keywords max in development. It uses the Text Search Enterprise SKU (for rating and review count).
- Results are merged; your own business is excluded (also under an old moved listing).
- Ranked by best position across keywords, then number of keywords, then review count. Top 10.
- Cached for 24 hours per keyword set; `refresh=true` searches again.

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-26T10:00:00.000Z", "cached": false,
  "keywords_used": ["emergency plumber", "drain cleaning"], "api_calls": 2,
  "suggestions": [
    { "place_id": "ChIJsuggestTest0000000005", "name": "Danforth Pipe Works", "address": "105 Pape Ave, Toronto, ON M4M 1A5, Canada",
      "rating": 4.4, "userRatingCount": 75, "best_position": 1,
      "keywords": [{ "keyword": "emergency plumber", "position": 6 }, { "keyword": "drain cleaning", "position": 1 }],
      "already_selected": false }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:**

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 400 | No keywords, or no coordinates yet (a service-area business gets them after its first ranking run) |
| 429 | Daily search limit reached |
| 502 | Every search failed |

### `GET /api/v1/places/search?q=&locationId=`

- Manual competitor search: 1 Pro call, up to 10 results, near the location.
- `q` is 2–100 characters. `locationId` is required and must be yours (404 otherwise).
- The location itself is excluded.

```json
{ "results": [{ "place_id": "ChIJ…", "name": "Rival Plumbing", "address": "5 King St, Toronto, ON" }], "api_calls": 1 }
```

**Daily limit:** suggestions and manual search share `PLACES_USER_DAILY_LIMIT` (default 50) Places calls per user per UTC day. Over the limit returns **429** "Daily search limit reached".

### `POST /api/v1/onboarding/complete`

Body: `{ "location_id" }`. It requires a center (lat/lng) and at least 1 keyword; **no GBP binding is needed** (since Phase 8: locations added from a Places search finish setup too).

- **400** `{ "reason": "center_required" }`: set the center first (`PUT /locations/:id/center`).
- **400** `{ "reason": "keywords_required" }`: add keywords first (`PUT /locations/:id/tracking`). `GET /locations/:id/competitor-suggestions` answers the same before keywords exist.

```json
{ "completed": true, "completed_at": "2026-09-26T10:05:00.000Z",
  "rank_run": { "run_id": "66f5…", "status": "queued", "existing": false },
  "gbp_sync": { "requested_at": "2026-09-26T10:05:00.000Z" } }
```

- It queues the first rank run and, when the location is GBP-bound, the first GBP sync; it sets the monthly refresh schedule.
- Calling it again returns the same state without queuing another run.
- **422:** the run would exceed `RANK_MAX_CALLS_PER_RUN`.

---

## Refresh and GBP sync (Phase 7b)

The data cadence (Mohit, 2026-09-26):
- **Monthly automatic refresh** per location: a rank run and, if the location is GBP-connected, a GBP sync. It is staggered on the day of the month the location completed setup (clamped to 28), at about 03:00 local.
- **Manual refresh** at most once per 24 h per type (`REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS`).
- **Pages never call Google.** Rankings come from `RankRun`; GBP data from the stored sync (the GBP report arrives in 7c).

### `POST /api/v1/locations/:locationId/refresh`

Body: `{ "types"?: ["rankings", "gbp"] }`. By default: rankings, plus gbp when the location is connected.

```json
{
  "rankings": { "run_id": "66f6…", "status": "queued", "existing": false, "estimate": { "idsOnly": { "min": 26, "max": 78, "maxWithRetries": 156 }, "…": "…" },
                "dev_capped": true, "next_allowed_at": "2026-09-27T13:00:00.000Z" },
  "gbp": { "sync_id": "66f6…", "status": "queued", "existing": false, "estimated_calls": 13, "next_allowed_at": "2026-09-27T13:00:00.000Z" }
}
```

- **7c:** a refresh that queues something also marks the competitor Place Details for refetch: the report generated after it refreshes competitor facts older than 24 h.
- **Inside the 24 h window a type is skipped:** `{ "skipped": "rate_limited", "next_allowed_at": "…" }`.
- An unconnected location gets `"gbp": { "skipped": "gbp_not_connected", "next_allowed_at": null }` (only when gbp was requested explicitly).
- **429** when every requested type is rate-limited (the same body shape). **202** otherwise.
- `estimated_calls` counts GBP API calls (free, quota-limited): performance 1, keywords 1 per month (6 on the first sync, 2 later), profile + attributes + attribute names (2026-10-02) + Google edits + verification 5, one possible token refresh; with v4 also reviews, media, customer media, posts. Extra pages add more.

`POST /locations/:id/rank-runs` ("run now") is the same as a rankings refresh: it shares the limit and returns **429** `{ next_allowed_at }` inside the window.

**Tokens (Phase 13a).** Each type that is newly queued spends its token cost (`tokens.cost` in the GET below; default 1 each, set by an admin). The monthly automatic refresh is free.
- Not enough tokens for everything that would be queued → **402** `{ "reason": "insufficient_tokens", "balance": 0, "cost": 2, "costs_by_type": { "rankings": 1, "gbp": 1 } }`. Nothing is queued and the 24 h limit isn't used up.
- A rate-limited type, or one already in progress (`existing: true`), costs nothing.
- A refresh that fails entirely (rank run or GBP sync `failed`, including the stuck guards) is refunded automatically; the ledger shows the spend and the refund (`GET /billing/tokens/ledger`).
- A cost of 0 makes that type free.

### `GET /api/v1/locations/:locationId/refresh`

```json
{ "frequency": "auto_monthly", "gbp_connected": true,
  "next_refresh_at": "2026-10-26T09:00:00.000Z", "last_auto_refresh_at": null,
  "rankings": { "next_allowed_at": "2026-09-27T13:00:00.000Z", "active_run": { "run_id": "66f6…", "status": "running" } },
  "gbp": { "next_allowed_at": null, "active_sync": null, "last_synced_at": "2026-09-26T09:02:11.000Z" },
  "reviews": { "synced_with_gbp": true, "in_progress": false, "last_refreshed_at": "2026-10-02T12:00:00.000Z", "next_allowed_at": null, "last_synced_at": "2026-09-26T09:02:11.000Z" },
  "report": { "pending": true, "scheduled_for": "2026-09-26T13:04:00.000Z", "last_generated_at": "2026-08-26T09:07:40.000Z" },
  "tokens": { "cost": { "rankings": 1, "gbp": 1 }, "balance": 12 } }
```

`reviews` (2026-10-02; `null` without GBP): reviews are stored by every GBP sync (`in_progress` while one runs) and by the Refresh Reviews button (`last_refreshed_at`, `next_allowed_at`). Nothing else about reviews or AI runs in the background.

- `next_allowed_at: null` means the type can be refreshed now.
- `tokens` (Phase 13a): the token cost per manual refresh type and the organization's balance.
- `report` (7c): `pending` while a GBP report generation is scheduled (it runs about 2 minutes after a rank run or sync finishes).

### `GET /api/v1/locations/:locationId/gbp/sync[?syncId=]`

The latest (or the given) GBP sync:

```json
{
  "gbp_connected": true,
  "sync": {
    "sync_id": "66f6…", "status": "done", "trigger": "onboarding", "backfill": true,
    "run_at": "2026-09-26T09:00:00.000Z", "started_at": "…", "finished_at": "…", "duration_ms": 4210,
    "types": {
      "performance":  { "status": "ok", "message": null, "rows": 6039, "range": { "from": "2025-03-26", "to": "2026-09-25" } },
      "keywords":     { "status": "ok", "message": null, "rows": 214, "range": { "from": "2026-03", "to": "2026-08" } },
      "profile":      { "status": "ok", "message": null, "rows": 1, "range": null },
      "verification": { "status": "ok", "message": null, "rows": 1, "range": null },
      "reviews":      { "status": "not_available", "message": "v4_access_pending", "rows": 0, "range": null },
      "media":        { "status": "not_available", "message": "v4_access_pending", "rows": 0, "range": null },
      "posts":        { "status": "not_available", "message": "v4_access_pending", "rows": 0, "range": null }
    },
    "api_calls": { "total": 11, "by_endpoint": { "performance.dailyMetrics": 1, "performance.searchKeywords": 6, "…": "…" } },
    "failure_reason": null
  },
  "last_synced_at": "2026-09-26T09:00:04.000Z"
}
```

- **Windows:** the first sync backfills 18 months of daily performance and 6 months of search keywords. Later (monthly) syncs fetch a rolling 40 days of performance and the last 2 complete months of keywords. Everything is upserted.
- **Per type:** one failing type makes the sync `partial`; the others are still stored. "Reconnect needed" or "API access not approved (quota 0)" stops the remaining calls and marks them `error` with that message.
- **Before any sync:** `{ "gbp_connected": false, "sync": null, "last_synced_at": null }`.

## GBP report (Phase 7c)

**Generated in a job, never on a page view.** The `gbp-report` job runs about 2 minutes (`REPORT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`) after a rank run or a GBP sync finishes, after a change of tracked competitors, and after an unbind. A rank run and a sync finishing together give one report; while either is still running the report waits for it. The stored report is overwritten each time (no history of competitor data); only the client's own scores are kept in `score_history` (last 24).

Examples below come from `npm run seed:demo-orgs` (offline demo data), trimmed.

### `GET /api/v1/locations/:locationId/gbp/report[?range=28d|90d|12m]`

`range` picks the performance window (default `28d`; `12m` = 365 days). Everything else is range-independent.

**Verification (2026-10-02):** `verified` is Google's "Voice of Merchant" (the owner controls the profile). `state` is `verified`, `verification_required`, `verification_pending`, `waiting_for_voice_of_merchant`, `ownership_conflict` or `comply_with_guidelines` (then `guidance` says what Google wants). `latest` / `verified_at` come from Google's verification history. When the last sync couldn't read verification, the previous result is shown with `stale: true` and `error`; with no previous result the section is `{ available: false, reason: "sync_failed", message }` (e.g. the My Business Verifications API is not enabled for the Cloud project).

**Sections that can't be shown** are `{ "available": false, "reason": "…" }`:

| reason | When |
|---|---|
| `gbp_not_connected` | The location has no GBP binding (added via Places search). Every private section: `gbp_score`, `profile`, `performance`, `keywords`, `reviews`, `media`, `posts`, `pending_google_edits`, `verification`, `sync`. The competitor comparison still works. |
| `v4_access_pending` | `reviews`, `media`, `posts` until Google approves v4 access (`GBP_V4_ENABLED=false`). The GBP Score then excludes the Activity and Reviews pillars: `partial: true`, `excluded_pillars: ["activity", "reviews"]`, rescaled to 100. |
| `not_synced_yet` | Bound, but the first sync hasn't stored that data yet. |
| `no_place_id` | `competitors` for a location without a place ID. |

**No ranking data in the GBP report (version 2, Mohit, 2026-10-02).** Ranks are in the ranking pages and the Rank Tracker report only. The GBP Score, the Public Score, the competitor rows and the insights use no rank-run data (the latest map list only picks which nearby businesses to compare).

**GBP Score (version 2):** 4 pillars, completeness 25, activity 20 (v4), reviews 25 (v4), **performance 30** (Google's own numbers: impressions trend 6, actions per 1,000 impressions 5, actions trend 5 points). Version 1 had visibility 20 (average map rank 8, top-3 rate 6, impressions trend 6) and engagement 10. Weights and thresholds in `src/gbp/scoring.config.ts`. A check without data is `not_available`; a pillar with no available check is excluded and the rest rescaled (`partial: true`). Grades: A ≥ 85, B ≥ 70, C ≥ 55, D ≥ 40, F.
- **`state`** per check: `pass` (full points), `partial` (some), `fail` (0), `not_available` (no data, not scored). Per pillar: `pass` / `fail` when every scored check is, `partial` when mixed, `not_available` when excluded; plus `counts`. `gbp_score.counts` sums all checks. Build "healthy" / "needs work" on these, not on `points`.
- **`why_it_matters`** per check: one or two sentences for the detail drawer.
- **v4 off** (`v4_enabled: false`): Activity and Reviews are excluded, so the score is **Completeness + Performance** (55 of the 100 weights, rescaled to 100), `partial: true`.

**`score_history`:** each entry has `version` (1 = with ranking data, before 2026-10-02; 2 = now). Draw a marker where it changes; don't compare scores across it (CHANGELOG `gbp_score_v2`). Production starts on a fresh database, so real customers only have version 2.

**`profile`** (2026-10-02): the Business Profile as last synced (`taken_at`): title, description, categories, regular hours, special-hour dates, phones, website, service area, labels, open status, attributes, service items, `maps_uri`, `new_review_uri` (the "write a review" link), `latlng`. `{ available: false, reason }` as the other private sections. A report generated before this change has `not_synced_yet` until the next generation.
- **Attribute names (2026-10-02):** each attribute has Google's English `display_name`, `group` (e.g. "Accessibility", "Payments") and `value_labels` (Google's label per value; a yes/no attribute gets Google's sentence, e.g. "Has wheelchair accessible entrance"; a URL attribute its links). They come from Google's attribute list during each GBP sync (one extra free call). `null` when that list couldn't be read, or until the next sync: fall back to a readable form of `name`.

**Public Score (version 2):** the same formula for the client and every competitor, from public Place Details only: rating 25, review count 20, public profile 25 (category, hours, website, phone, editorial summary), rescaled to 100. Closed businesses score 0 with a `flag`. Version 1 also had center rank 20 and center top-3 10.

**Insights:** `review_gap`, `rating_gap`, `missing_hours`, `missing_website`, `missing_phone`, `category_mismatch`, `photos_gap`, `review_freshness` (`rank_gap` was removed on 2026-10-02).

**Freshness:** after a manual GBP refresh (`POST /refresh { types: ["gbp"] }`) the sync runs, then the report regenerates about 2 minutes later (`REPORT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`, 120). Show `generation.pending` / `generation.scheduled_for` and the sync state (`GET /locations/:id/gbp/sync`) until `generated_at` changes.

**Not supported** (don't build): duplicate listings, website signals beyond "website set", competitor citations / links / authority, Google Q&A.

**Competitors:** the client, `tracking.competitors`, then the top 3 other businesses of the first keyword's map list (max 5 competitors). Place Details are fetched at most once per monthly cycle per business, or on a manual refresh (older than 24 h). A failed fetch keeps the previous facts with `stale: true` and `error`; without a Places key the section has `warning: "places_not_configured"`.

**Errors:** **404** before the first report (`"No GBP report yet: it is generated after the first rank run or GBP sync."`), **400** for another `range`.

For an unbound location (trimmed):

```json
{ "gbp_connected": false, "gbp_score": { "available": false, "reason": "gbp_not_connected" },
  "performance": { "available": false, "reason": "gbp_not_connected" }, "…": "…",
  "competitors": { "available": true, "rows": [ "… client and competitors with public_score …" ], "insights": [ "…" ] },
  "score_history": [ { "generated_at": "…", "gbp_score": null, "grade": null, "public_score": 71, "version": 2 } ] }
```

## Auth, organizations, locations and clients (Phase 8)

Every location, client and report belongs to an **organization** (Business or Agency). A user acts in an organization through a membership: `owner` (everything), `member` (everything except editing the organization), `client_user` (agency; read-only, only the locations of its assigned clients).

- **Current organization:** the `X-Organization-Id` header (one of the caller's organizations, else **403** `not_a_member`), otherwise the user's default organization. No organization → **403** `{ "reason": "no_organization" }`.
- **Location routes** (`/locations/:locationId/...`, including tracking, rank runs, refresh and the GBP report) check membership of the location's organization: another organization's location is **404**; a `client_user` write is **403** `{ "reason": "read_only" }`.
- **Refusals carry a reason** in `data`: `read_only`, `agency_only`, `owner_only`, `duplicate_place`, `place_id_mismatch`, `email_not_verified`, `rate_limited`, and (Phase 13a) `subscription_required`, `organization_suspended`, `location_payment_required`, `enterprise_required`, `user_limit_reached`, `feature_not_included`, `insufficient_tokens`.

Examples come from `npm run seed:demo-orgs` (offline demo data), trimmed.

### Auth (`/api/v1/auth`)

**Email verification is by link (Phase 8.1).** Signup emails `FRONTEND_URL/verify-email?token=<token>`. The token is random, stored only as a hash, single use, and valid 24 h (`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TTL_HOURS`). An account not verified within 24 h of signup is deleted (hourly job), and the email can sign up again. Password reset is by link too (13b; no codes or OTP anywhere): see `POST /auth/forgot-password` below.

**Rate limits** (per email, and per IP): above a limit → **429** `{ "reason": "rate_limited", "retry_after_seconds": 3599 }`.

| Action | Limit |
|---|---|
| Signup | 5/h per IP |
| Login | 10/15 min per email + IP |
| Verify | 30/15 min per IP |
| Resend | 3/h per email, 10/h per IP |
| Forgot | 3/h per email, 20/h per IP |
| Reset | 10/15 min |

`POST /auth/signup`

```json
{ "account_type": "agency", "name": "Pat Owner", "email": "pat@agency.example", "password": "secret123",
  "organization_name": "Pat Agency", "country": "US", "accept_terms": true }
```
→ **201** `{ "user_id": "…", "organization_id": "…", "email_verification": "sent", "verify_before": "2026-09-28T10:00:00.000Z" }`.
- The password needs 8+ characters with a letter and a digit.
- A taken email → **409** `{ "reason": "email_taken" }`. An unverified account past its 24 h is removed first, so its email is free again.
- The frontend shows "Check your email" with a **Resend link** button (`POST /auth/resend-verification`).

**The `/verify-email` page (frontend):**
1. Read `token` from the query string and call `POST /auth/verify-email { "token": "…" }` once, on load.
2. Handle the answer:

| Answer | Meaning | Page |
|---|---|---|
| **200** `{ verified: true, already_verified: false, tokens, user, organizations, current_organization_id, onboarding }` | Verified now | Store the tokens and continue to onboarding (`onboarding.next_step`) |
| **200** `{ verified: true, already_verified: true }` (no tokens) | The link was used before | "Your email is already verified." + a **Log in** button (not an error page) |
| **400** `{ reason: "link_expired" }` | The link is older than 24 h, or the account's 24 h ran out | "This link has expired." + an email field and **Send a new link** |
| **400** `{ reason: "link_invalid" }` | Unknown token, or a newer link was sent | "This link isn't valid." + **Send a new link** (only the newest link works) |
| **400** (validation message, no reason) | No or malformed `token` | Same as `link_invalid` |
| **429** `rate_limited` | Too many tries | "Try again in a few minutes." |

`POST /auth/verify-email` `{ "token" }`, first time:

```json
{ "verified": true, "already_verified": false,
  "tokens": { "access": { "token": "…", "expires": "…" }, "refresh": { "token": "…", "expires": "…" } },
  "user": { "id": "…", "email": "pat@agency.example", "name": "Pat Owner", "user_type": "AGENCY" },
  "organizations": [ { "organization_id": "…", "name": "Pat Agency", "type": "agency", "role": "owner" } ],
  "current_organization_id": "…",
  "onboarding": { "id": "…", "type": "agency", "steps": [ { "id": "agency_info", "status": "done" }, { "id": "google", "status": "pending" }, "…" ],
                  "next_step": "google", "completed": false, "completed_at": null } }
```

| Endpoint | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/resend-verification` | `{ email }` | **200** `{ "email_verification": "sent_if_pending" }`, the same for unknown, already-verified or expired accounts. A new link makes every older link `link_invalid`. |
| `POST /auth/login` | `{ email, password }` | The session (as above, without `verified` / `already_verified`). Unverified (after a correct password) → **403** `{ "reason": "email_not_verified", "resend": "/api/v1/auth/resend-verification" }`, no tokens: show "Verify your email" + **Send a new link**. Wrong email or password → **401** (one message for both). Disabled → **403** `account_disabled`. |
| `POST /auth/forgot-password` | `{ email }` | **200** `{ "reset": "sent_if_account_exists" }`, the same for unknown accounts. Emails `FRONTEND_URL/reset-password?token=<token>` (13b): random, stored only as a hash, single use, valid 60 minutes (`PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_MINUTES`); a newer link makes older ones `link_invalid`. 3 per email and 20 per IP an hour. |
| `POST /auth/reset-password` | `{ token, password, confirm_password }` (the `/reset-password` page reads `token` from the link) | **200** `{ "reset": true }`; every session ends (log in again). The link proves the mailbox, so a still-unverified email becomes verified. **400** `{ "reason": "link_invalid" }` (unknown, replaced or already used), `link_expired` (offer "send a new link"), `passwords_do_not_match`; a password that breaks the rules → **400** with the rule. |

Accepting a team invitation also verifies the email (a new account is created verified; an existing unverified one is marked verified).

#### Sessions and the account (Phase 10; moved to `/auth` in 13b)

| Token | Lifetime | Config | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access | **1 day** | `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_DAYS` (default 1) | `Authorization: Bearer <access>` on every user endpoint |
| Refresh | **30 days** | `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS` (default 30) | only in the refresh and logout bodies; stored server-side (revocable) |

**Refresh (rotating):** on a **401** from any user endpoint, call once:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
{ "refresh_token": "eyJ…" }
→ 200 { "tokens": { "access": { "token": "eyJ…", "expires": "…" }, "refresh": { "token": "eyJ…", "expires": "…" } } }
```

Store **both** new tokens: the refresh token just used stops working (each refresh gives a new one, valid 30 days). Retry the original request with the new access token. If the refresh answers **401** ("Your session has ended"), clear the tokens and go to login. Never retry a failed refresh in a loop; run one refresh at a time and let concurrent 401s wait for it.

**Logout:** `POST /api/v1/auth/logout { "refresh_token" }` ends that session (drop the access token on the client; it expires within a day).

**The signed-in user:** `GET /api/v1/auth/me` →

```json
{ "id": "…", "email": "pat@example.com", "name": "Pat", "mobile": null, "user_type": "BUSINESS", "email_verified_at": "…", "created_at": "…",
  "last_login_at": "…", "organizations": [{ "organization_id": "…", "name": "Pat Co", "type": "business", "role": "owner" }], "current_organization_id": "…" }
```

`PATCH /api/v1/auth/me { "name"?, "mobile"? }` returns the same shape. Business details (name, country, address) belong to the organization (`PATCH /organization`, billing details).

**Change password** (signed in): `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password { "current_password", "new_password" }` → `{ "tokens": … }`. Every other session ends (other devices get 401); continue with the returned tokens. **400** `wrong_password`, `same_password`. The new password follows the signup rules (8+ characters, a letter and a digit).

**Delete the account:** `POST /api/v1/auth/deactivate { "password" }` → `{ "deleted": true }`. Every connected Google account is disconnected (revoked at Google, its profiles unbound), memberships end, every session is revoked, and the account is deleted. **400** `wrong_password`.

### Organization (`/api/v1/organization`)

`GET /organization`

```json
{ "organization": { "id": "6ab8…7270", "name": "Northern Local SEO", "type": "agency", "country": "CA", "created_at": "…" },
  "role": "owner",
  "memberships": [ { "organization_id": "6ab8…7270", "name": "Northern Local SEO", "type": "agency", "role": "owner" } ] }
```

`GET /organization/usage`

```json
{ "plan": { "id": "6ab8…", "name": "Standard", "kind": "standard" },
  "billing": { "state": "active", "read_only": false, "trial_ends_at": "2026-10-05T…", "current_period_end": "2026-10-28T…" },
  "locations": { "used": 3, "limit": 5, "max": 20 }, "users": { "used": 4, "limit": 15 }, "tokens": { "balance": 12 },
  "keywords": { "used": 9, "limit": null }, "clients": { "used": 2 } }
```

**Phase 13a billing** (the full billing API is in "Billing (Phase 13a)"):
- **`locations.limit`:** the trial allowance (1) or the paid quantity; `max` is the plan's cap (20 on the standard plan).
- **`users.limit`:** 3 per paid location, pooled; the owner and pending invitations count.
- **Keywords:** there is no organization-wide cap (20 per location always applies). `clients` is `null` for a business.
- **Adding a location beyond the limit:**
  - in the trial → **402** `{ "reason": "subscription_required" }`
  - with a subscription → **402** `{ "reason": "location_payment_required", "used": 5, "paid": 5, "quote": { "quantity": 1, "amount": 14.5, "currency": "USD", "lines": [ … ], "period_end": "…", "new_paid_quantity": 6 } }`: pay the quote, then retry
  - beyond the cap → **403** `{ "reason": "enterprise_required", "used": 20, "max": 20 }`
- Deleting a location frees its slot for the rest of the paid period (no refund).
- **Invitations** beyond the user pool: **403** `{ "reason": "user_limit_reached", "used": 6, "limit": 6 }`. Existing users keep access when the pool shrinks.

`PATCH /organization` (owner) `{ name?, country? }` → as GET. `GET /organization/members` (owner/member) → `[{ user_id, name, email, role, client_ids, status }]`.

### Locations (`/api/v1/locations`)

`GET /locations?search=&client_id=&status=&sort=name|city|rank|gbp_score|rating|citation_score|last_refreshed&order=asc|desc&page=&limit=` (default `sort=name`, `limit=25`, max 100):

```json
{ "locations": [
    { "location_id": "6ab8…727b", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "city": "Toronto", "country": "Canada",
      "client": { "client_id": "6ab8…7275", "name": "Maple Leaf Group" }, "source": "gbp", "gbp_connected": true,
      "status": "active", "rank": { "overall_avg_rank": 21.3, "change": 12.6 }, "gbp": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "partial": false },
      "reviews": { "rating": 4.6, "count": 64 }, "citations": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "nap_wrong": 1 },
      "last_refreshed_at": "2026-09-26T18:23:14.983Z", "next_refresh_at": "2026-10-16T18:27:14.983Z" },
    { "name": "Danforth Drain Pros", "source": "places_search", "gbp_connected": false, "status": "gbp_not_connected",
      "rank": { "overall_avg_rank": 10, "change": 0 }, "gbp": null, "reviews": { "rating": 4.3, "count": 38 }, "…": "…" } ],
  "page": 1, "limit": 25, "total": 3 }
```

- **`status`**, first match wins: `setup_required` (onboarding not completed, or no keywords), `reconnect_required` (GBP bound but its Google connection is revoked or gone), `gbp_disconnected` (2026-10-01: its GBP was unbound; `gbp_disconnected_at`), `gbp_not_connected` (never had GBP), `active`.
- **`center`** (location header, 2026-10-01): `{ source: "place" | "manual", label, lat, lng }` or `null` before a center exists: where rankings are measured from (see RunMeta).
- `rank`, `gbp` and `reviews` come from the latest rank run and GBP report (`null` before there is one). Without GBP, `reviews` shows the public Place Details rating.
- **`citations`** (2026-10-08): Citation Health `{ score, grade, nap_wrong }`, the same shape as the agency dashboard table; `null` until the MyPageSEO team has checked at least one listing. `sort=citation_score` sorts by it.

`POST /locations` `{ "place_id": "ChIJ…", "client_id"?: "…" }`: add a location from a `GET /places/search` result (no manual entry). One Place Details call (id, name, address with components, location, phone, website, category). US/CA only.

```json
{ "location": { "location_id": "…", "name": "Fredericton Plumbing Co", "city": "Fredericton", "state": "NB", "country": "Canada",
                "source": "places_search", "gbp_connected": false, "status": "setup_required",
                "onboarding": { "step": "place_selected", "started_at": "…", "completed_at": null }, "…": "…" },
  "api_calls": 1 }
```

→ **201**. The same place already in the organization → **409** `{ "reason": "duplicate_place", "location_id": "…" }`. Beyond the billing limits → **402** `subscription_required` / `location_payment_required` (with a `quote`) or **403** `enterprise_required` (Phase 13a; checked before the Places call). Then set keywords and competitors and call `POST /onboarding/complete`.

`GET /places/search?q=` without `locationId` is the add-location search (the organization's country, or `&country=US|CA`); each result carries `already_added` (a location id or `null`).

`GET /locations/:locationId` → the header: `{ location_id, name, address, city, state, country, zip_code, phone, website, business_category, place_id, source, gbp_connected, gbp_disconnected_at, status, client, lat, lng, center, timezone, onboarding, created_at }` (`center`, `gbp_disconnected_at`: 2026-10-01).

`GET /locations/:locationId/overview` → the header plus the latest stored summaries:

```json
{ "…header": "…",
  "rankings": { "available": true, "run_id": "…", "run_at": "2026-09-25T18:27:14.983Z", "status": "partial", "overall_avg_rank": 21.3, "change": 12.6,
                "keywords": 3, "trend": [ { "run_at": "2026-08-26T18:27:14.983Z", "overall_avg_rank": 33.9 }, { "run_at": "2026-09-25T18:27:14.983Z", "overall_avg_rank": 21.3 } ] },
  "gbp": { "available": true, "score": 50, "grade": "D", "partial": false,
           "top_fixes": [ { "id": "map_rank", "label": "Average map rank", "fix_hint": "Improve relevance and prominence for your keywords (categories, reviews, posts)." }, "…" ] },
  "performance": { "available": true, "range": "28d", "impressions": 6871, "actions": 312, "impressions_change": 0.068, "actions_change": 0.072 },
  "reviews": { "available": true, "rating": 4.6, "count": 64, "unreplied": 10 },
  "competitors": { "available": true, "tracked": 1, "compared": 4, "public_score": 71,
                   "best_competitor": { "place_id": "ChIJdemoDanforthDrainPros03", "name": "Danforth Drain Pros", "public_score": 55 } },
  "citations": { "available": true, "score": 50, "grade": "D", "score_change": 16, "coverage": 0.83, "listings": 6,
                 "counts": { "not_checked": 1, "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "not_found": 1, "duplicate": 0, "submitted": 1, "pending": 0, "removed": 0 },
                 "last_checked_at": "2026-09-27T…" },
  "refresh": { "frequency": "auto_monthly", "next_refresh_at": "…", "rankings": { "…": "…" }, "gbp": { "…": "…" }, "report": { "…": "…" } },
  "empty_states": { "no_keywords": false, "no_competitors": false, "no_ranking_data": false, "gbp_not_connected": false, "no_reports": false } }
```

A section without data is `{ "available": false, "reason": … }`: `no_keywords`, `no_ranking_data`, `gbp_not_connected`, `no_report`, `no_competitors`, `v4_access_pending`, and for `citations` (2026-10-08) `no_citations_yet` (no list) or `not_checked_yet` (a list, nothing checked). The citation table itself is `GET /locations/:id/citations`.

`PATCH /locations/:locationId` (owner/member) `{ name?, timezone? (IANA), client_id? (agency; null to unassign) }` → the header. Business data (address, phone, …) comes from GBP / Places and can't be edited.

`DELETE /locations/:locationId` (owner/member): soft delete.

```json
{ "deleted": true, "gbp_unbound": true, "jobs_cancelled": { "rank_run": 0, "gbp_sync": 0, "gbp_report": 1 }, "usage": { "used": 2, "limit": 5 } }
```

Active runs and syncs are ended, their jobs cancelled, the GBP binding removed (tokens kept unless it was that Google account's last binding), history kept. The place can be added again later.

### Clients (`/api/v1/clients`, agency only)

A business organization gets **403** `{ "reason": "agency_only" }`. A `client_user` sees only its own clients, read-only.

`GET /clients?search=&status=ACTIVE|INACTIVE&page=&limit=` → `{ clients: [client], page, limit, total }`; `POST /clients` `{ name, website?, contact_email? }` → **201** client; `PATCH /clients/:clientId` `{ name?, website?, contact_email?, status? }`.

```json
{ "client_id": "6ab8…7275", "name": "Maple Leaf Group", "website": "https://mapleleafgroup.example", "contact_email": "owner@mapleleafgroup.example",
  "status": "ACTIVE", "locations_count": 2, "avg_rank": 21.7, "avg_gbp_score": 49.5, "created_at": "…" }
```

`GET /clients/:clientId` → `{ client, locations: [rows as in GET /locations], summary: { locations: 2, avg_rank: 21.7, avg_gbp_score: 49.5, gbp_connected: 2 } }`.

| Endpoint | Response |
|---|---|
| `DELETE /clients/:clientId` | `{ "deleted": true, "locations_unassigned": 1 }` (its locations stay in the organization) |
| `POST /clients/:clientId/locations` `{ location_id }` | `{ "assigned": true, "client_id", "location_id" }` (the location must be in the organization, else 404) |
| `DELETE /clients/:clientId/locations/:locationId` | `{ "unassigned": true, … }` |

### Onboarding (Phase 8 changes)

`GET /onboarding/state` now starts with the organization's steps (derived from data, resumable):

```json
{ "organization": { "id": "…", "type": "agency",
    "steps": [ { "id": "agency_info", "status": "done" }, { "id": "google", "status": "done" },
               { "id": "first_location", "status": "done" }, { "id": "location_setup", "status": "done" }, { "id": "reporting_brand", "status": "done" } ],
    "next_step": null, "completed": true, "completed_at": "…" },
  "empty_states": { "no_locations": false, "google_not_connected": false, "no_ranking_data": false, "no_keywords": false, "no_competitors": false, "no_reports": false },
  "gbp": { "connected": true, "connections": [ "…" ] },
  "locations": [ { "location_id": "…", "name": "…", "source": "gbp", "client_id": "…", "onboarding": { "step": "completed", "…": "…" } } ] }
```

- **Business steps:** `organization_info` → `google` → `first_location` → `location_setup`. **Agency:** `agency_info` → `google` → `first_location` → `location_setup` → `reporting_brand` (clients are optional grouping, not a step: 2026-10-01) (Phase 12: `done` once any branding is saved with `PUT /organization/branding`; skippable). Status: `done | pending | skipped | not_available`.
- `POST /onboarding/skip { "step": "google" | "reporting_brand" }` (owner/member): skip Google to add locations from a Places search.
- **Location steps:** `profile_selected` (GBP) or `place_selected` (Places search) → (`center_needed` → `center_set`) → `keywords_set` → `competitors_set` → `completed`.
- Binding a picked Business Profile location (`POST /gbp/picks/:pickId/bind`, 2026-10-01) accepts `client_id` and is limit-checked when it creates a location. A location of the organization with the same place is linked (connect GBP later). A location with a **different** place → **409** `{ "reason": "place_id_mismatch", "location_place_id", "gbp_place_id" }` (also for `POST /gbp/bind`).
- `POST /onboarding/complete` no longer needs a GBP binding: it queues the first rank run, the first GBP sync only when bound, and sets the monthly refresh.

## Dashboard and team (Phase 11)

Examples come from `npm run seed:demo-orgs` (offline demo data), trimmed.

### `GET /api/v1/dashboard[?page=&limit=&sort=name|client|rank|rank_change|gbp_score&order=asc|desc&location_id=&range=15d|30d|60d]`

The shape follows the organization type. **It reads only stored data**: the per-location summaries (`Location.summary`, written after every rank run and GBP report), location statuses and client names, and since 2026-10-02 the stored daily GBP metrics, reviews and report counts for the period blocks. No rank-run or report documents are read, and nothing calls Google. A `client_user` gets the agency shape for its assigned clients only.

**Location filter and period picker (2026-10-02).** `?location_id=` narrows every block to one location of the organization (404 `location_not_found` otherwise); `locations` still lists all of them for the picker, and `selected_location` echoes the choice (`null` = all). `?range=15d|30d|60d` (default `30d`) drives two blocks, both computed from stored data (`GbpMetricDaily`, `GbpReview`), so they change only after a refresh:

```json
{ "range": "30d",
  "selected_location": { "location_id": "6ab…a18", "name": "MyPageSEO Fredericton", "city": "Fredericton" },
  "performance": { "available": true, "range": "30d", "days": 30, "latest_date": "2026-09-28",
    "current":  { "impressions": 1840, "maps": 1210, "search": 630, "actions": 96, "calls": 22, "website_clicks": 51, "direction_requests": 23, "actions_per_1000_impressions": 52.2 },
    "previous": { "impressions": 1600, "maps": 1050, "search": 550, "actions": 88, "calls": 20, "website_clicks": 45, "direction_requests": 23, "actions_per_1000_impressions": 55 },
    "change":   { "impressions": 0.15, "maps": 0.152, "search": 0.145, "actions": 0.091, "calls": 0.1, "website_clicks": 0.133, "direction_requests": 0, "actions_per_1000_impressions": -0.051 },
    "coverage": { "current": { "days_with_data": 30, "days": 30 }, "previous": { "days_with_data": 30, "days": 30 } } },
  "visibility": { "avg_rank": 8.4, "change": 2.1, "top3_rate": 0.4, "top3_rate_change": 0.1, "trend": [] },
  "reviews": { "available": true, "rating": 4.6, "rating_change": -0.05, "new_in_range": 4, "count": 41 },
  "citations": { "available": true, "score": 72, "score_change": 5 } }
```

- Each location's window ends at its latest day with data (Google lags a few days); `change` is a fraction (0.15 = +15 %) and `null` when either window has under the minimum day coverage or the base is 0. Without a bound GBP: `{ "available": false, "reason": "gbp_not_connected", "range": "30d" }`; bound but no data yet: `reason: "no_data"`.
- `reviews.rating_change`: the average rating of all stored reviews now minus the average of the reviews that existed at the start of the range (2 decimals; `null` without earlier reviews). Only in the review-management shape (v4).
- `visibility.top3_rate_change`: vs the previous run, on the keywords both runs have (+0.1 = 10 points more top-3 positions). `citations.score_change`: the last movement of the Citation Health score, kept while the score stays the same.
- **Agency** adds the same `range`, `selected_location`, `performance` and `reviews` blocks, plus `reports: { "ready": 12, "scheduled": 3, "failed": 1 }` (ready / failed: not archived, for the visible locations; scheduled: active schedules), `portfolio.avg_top3_rate_change`, and `table.rows[].city` + `visibility.top3_rate_change`.

**Business:**

```json
{ "type": "business", "locations_count": 1,
  "visibility": { "avg_rank": 21.3, "change": 12.6, "top3_rate": 0.07,
                  "trend": [ { "run_at": "2026-07-27T…", "avg_rank": 22.9 }, { "run_at": "2026-08-26T…", "avg_rank": 33.9 }, { "run_at": "2026-09-25T…", "avg_rank": 21.3 } ] },
  "gbp": { "available": true, "score": 50, "grade": "D", "change": -13, "partial": false },
  "reviews": { "available": true, "rating": 4.6, "count": 64, "unreplied": 10 },
  "movement": { "improved": 2, "declined": 0, "unchanged": 0, "entered_top_60": 1, "dropped_out_of_top_60": 0, "not_comparable": 0 },
  "key_competitor": { "place_id": "ChIJdemoDanforthDrainPros03", "name": "Danforth Drain Pros", "avg_rank": 10, "self_avg_rank": 21.3, "ahead": true,
                      "location_id": "…", "location_name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating" },
  "recommended_actions": [
    { "id": "ranking:competitor_ahead", "source": "ranking", "location_id": "…", "location_name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating",
      "title": "Danforth Drain Pros ranks ahead of you", "detail": "Average rank 10 vs your 21.3. Compare their reviews, categories and posts.", "impact": 0.57 },
    { "id": "gbp:map_rank", "source": "gbp", "title": "Average map rank", "detail": "Improve relevance and prominence for your keywords (categories, reviews, posts).", "impact": 0.35, "…": "…" } ],
  "refresh": { "last_refreshed_at": "2026-09-26T…", "next_refresh_at": "2026-10-16T…" },
  "status_counts": { "active": 1, "setup_required": 0, "gbp_not_connected": 0, "reconnect_required": 0 },
  "locations": [ { "location_id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "status": "active", "avg_rank": 21.3, "change": 12.6, "gbp_score": 50 } ] }
```

- **`visibility`:** `avg_rank` is the overall average map rank (the lower the better). `change` is the previous run minus the latest (positive = improved). `top3_rate` is the share of tracker points in the top 3. With several locations these are the means over the locations with data, and the trend is averaged from the latest run backwards.
- **`gbp`:** `{ available: false, reason: "gbp_not_connected" | "no_report" }` without data. `change` is the difference from the previous report.
- **`reviews`:** `{ available: false, reason: "v4_access_pending" | "gbp_not_connected", public_rating, public_review_count }` until v4 access. The public numbers come from Place Details.
- **`movement`:** keyword changes of the latest rank run vs the previous one (summed over locations).
- **`key_competitor`:** the tracked competitor furthest ahead (or the best-ranked one when none is ahead), or `null`.
- **`recommended_actions`:** the top 5 by `impact` (0–1) across locations. Sources:
  - `connection` (reconnect Google)
  - `setup` (finish setup)
  - `ranking` (a keyword that dropped out of the top 60, the biggest decline, a competitor ahead)
  - `gbp` (the GBP Score's top fixes)

**Agency:**

```json
{ "type": "agency", "clients_count": 2, "locations_count": 3,
  "portfolio": { "avg_rank": 17.8, "avg_rank_change": 4, "avg_top3_rate": 0.05, "avg_gbp_score": 47, "avg_gbp_score_change": -13 },

                                { "id": "holiday_hours", "label": "Holiday hours are missing for upcoming holidays" } ] } ],
  "recommended_actions": [ { "id": "connection:reconnect", "source": "connection", "location_name": "Queen West Plumbing Co.", "title": "Reconnect Google", "impact": 0.95, "…": "…" }, "…" ],
  "table": { "rows": [
      { "location_id": "…", "name": "Danforth Drain Pros", "client": { "client_id": "…", "name": "Danforth Services" }, "status": "gbp_not_connected",
        "visibility": { "avg_rank": 10, "change": 0, "top3_rate": 0.07 }, "gbp": null },
      { "location_id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "client": { "…": "…" }, "status": "active",

    "page": 1, "limit": 25, "total": 3 } }
```

- **`declines`:** locations whose average rank got worse, or with a keyword that dropped out of the top 60. Worst first, max 10.
- **`gbp_issues`:** `reconnect_required`, `not_verified`, `pending_google_edits`, `sync_failed`, `holiday_hours`; max 10 locations.
- **`table`:** sorted by `sort` / `order` (default `name`); locations without data sort last.

### Team (owner only)

`POST /organization/invitations` `{ "email": "new-teammate@example.com", "role": "member" }` or `{ …, "role": "client_user", "client_ids": ["…"] }` (agency only):

```json
{ "invitation_id": "…", "email": "new-teammate@example.com", "role": "member", "client_ids": [], "status": "pending",
  "expires_at": "2026-10-04T…", "invited_by": "…", "created_at": "…", "email_sent": true }
```

- **The link** is `${FRONTEND_URL}/invite?token=…`. The token is 32 random bytes, stored only as a SHA-256 hash, valid 7 days (`INVITATION_TTL_DAYS`), single use.
- **Inviting the same email again** while it's pending issues a new link; the old one stops working.
- **Development:** no email is sent; the server log shows `invitation for n***@example.com: <link>`.
- **Refusals:** **409** `already_member`; **403** `agency_only` (a client_user in a business); **400** without valid `client_ids`; **429** above 20 invitations an hour per organization.

| Endpoint | Response |
|---|---|
| `GET /organization/invitations[?status=pending\|accepted\|revoked\|expired]` | `[invitation]`, newest first |
| `DELETE /organization/invitations/:invitationId` | `{ "revoked": true, "invitation_id": "…" }` |
| `PATCH /organization/members/:userId` `{ role, client_ids? }` | `{ "user_id", "role", "client_ids" }` |
| `DELETE /organization/members/:userId` | `{ "removed": true, "user_id": "…" }`; the user's default organization moves to another membership |

The owner can't be changed or removed: **403** `{ "reason": "owner_protected" }`. Ownership transfer is not available. `GET /organization/members` rows now include `invited_by` (null for the owner) and `joined_at`.

### Accepting an invitation (public; the token goes in the body, never in the URL)

`POST /auth/invitations/inspect` `{ "token": "…" }`:

```json
{ "organization": { "name": "Northern Local SEO", "type": "agency" }, "email": "new-teammate@example.com", "role": "member",
  "status": "pending", "expires_at": "…", "account_exists": false }
```

**404** for an unknown token; **410** `{ "reason": "expired" | "revoked" | "accepted" }`.

`POST /auth/invitations/accept`:

| Body | Response |
|---|---|
| `{ token, name, password }` for a **new** email | The account is created (verified: the link proves the mailbox) and logged in: `{ "accepted": true, "organization_id", "login_required": false, "tokens", "user", "organizations", "current_organization_id", "onboarding" }` |
| `{ token }` for an **existing** account | `{ "accepted": true, "organization_id": "…", "login_required": true }`: the membership is added; log in normally (the link alone isn't a login) |

A new email without `name` / `password` → **400** `account_details_required`. Rate limit: 20 per 15 minutes per IP (inspect + accept).

## Reports center (Phase 12)

A report freezes stored data (the rank run, the GBP report, the profile snapshot) and the organization's branding in a **snapshot** when it is generated; the PDF is rendered once from it (PDFKit, no browser) and stored privately (`REPORTS_STORAGE_DIR`). Later rank runs, GBP reports or branding changes never change a generated report. Reports older than `REPORT_RETENTION_MONTHS` (24) lose their PDF and snapshot (`status: "expired"`).

**Types and sections** (`sections` optional; default all, in this order):

| Type | Sections |
|---|---|
| `rank_tracker` | `summary`, `keywords`, `history` (last 12 runs), `grid` (heatmap per keyword), `movers`, `map_ranking` (12.5), `keyword_groups` (17: only when the location has groups) |
| `gbp_audit` | `score`, `checks` (with top fixes), `performance` (`range` 28d/90d/12m), `keywords`, `profile` (with name/phone/website consistency), `verification`, `pending_edits`, `reviews_media_posts` (needs v4). **2026-10-02:** no ranking data; `score` has `version`, `counts` and a `state` + `counts` per pillar; `checks` have `state` and `why_it_matters`; `performance` has every metric (Maps / Search, mobile / desktop, calls, website clicks, directions, conversations and bookings when not 0) with its previous-period and last-year change, `by_surface`, `by_device`, and calls / website clicks / directions per day (the PDF draws a chart for each). |
| `competitor_analysis` | `public_scores`, `table`, `insights`, `reviews` (12.5). The `ranks` section was removed on 2026-10-02 (no ranking data outside the Rank Tracker report). |
| `citation` (Phase 16) | `score` (Citation Health, coverage, counts), `table` (every listing: directory, type, status, NAP issues, last checked), `nap_issues` (listed as vs should be), `changes` (the report's `range`) |
| `reputation` (2026-10-02) | `summary` (average, totals, new this month, 4-5 / 1-3, reply rate, awaiting attention, flagged), `distribution` (reviews per star), `needs_attention` (up to 10 unreplied low or flagged reviews with their indicators), `replies_sent` (this month, 90 days, the 5 latest), `insights` (the stored review insights, if generated). Stored data only: generating it never calls Google or OpenAI. **400** `no_reviews` without stored reviews. Also the fifth part of `full`. |
| `full` | the report types it combines: `rank_tracker`, `gbp_audit`, `competitor_analysis`, `citation` (Phase 16) |

A part that can't be shown is `{ available: false, reason }` in `snapshot.data` and an `unavailable` block in the document: `gbp_not_connected`, `v4_access_pending` ("Not available yet: this needs Google My Business v4 access"), `not_synced_yet`, `no_rank_run`, `no_gbp_report`. **Never sample data.**

### `POST /api/v1/reports`

```json
{ "location_id": "6ab8ad2e7c446457a3999f95", "type": "gbp_audit", "range": "90d" }
```

**A report for an older run (Phase 17):** send `run_id` (any finished run of the location, e.g. from `GET /locations/:id/rank-runs`) with a `rank_tracker` or `full` report: `{ "location_id": "…", "type": "rank_tracker", "run_id": "6ab6dc8a10f657b7c9476cff" }`. Without it the latest finished run is used. Every report row has `run_id` and `run_at` (the run's date; `null` for types without rankings), so the library can show which month a report covers.

**202**:

```json
{ "report_id": "6ab8ad550854cb0157d88bdf", "type": "gbp_audit", "sections": ["score", "checks", "performance", "keywords", "profile", "verification", "pending_edits", "reviews_media_posts"],
  "status": "queued", "trigger": "manual", "schedule_id": null,
  "location": { "location_id": "6ab8ad2e7c446457a3999f95", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating" },
  "client": { "client_id": "6ab8ad2e7c446457a3999f8f", "name": null },
  "range": "90d", "run_id": null, "run_at": null, "pdf": null, "failure_reason": null,
  "created_at": "2026-09-27T05:44:53.101Z", "generated_at": null, "expires_at": null, "archived_at": null, "existing": false }
```

- One active (queued/generating) report per location and type: a repeat returns the active one with `existing: true`.
- **400** `{ reason }`: `invalid_section` (with `allowed`), `no_rank_run`, `gbp_not_connected`, `no_gbp_report`, `no_data`. **404** for a location outside the organization. **403** `read_only` for a client_user.
- Poll `GET /reports/:id` until `status` is `ready` (or `failed` with `failure_reason`).

### `GET /api/v1/reports[?location_id=&client_id=&type=&status=&include_deleted=&page=&limit=]`

`status`: `queued | generating | ready | failed | expired | archived` (archived reports are listed only with `status=archived`).

**2026-10-02 (Mohit's decisions):**
- **Deleted locations:** their reports stay in the list with the real name and `location.deleted: true` (label them "Deleted location"); `include_deleted=false` hides them. PDFs and share links keep working.
- **Live rows:** `live` lists the stored, always-current pages per visible location: `type: "gbp_report"` (the GBP report, regenerated after every sync and rank run) and `type: "review_insights"` (when insights were generated). They have no PDF and no status: open the in-app page from `link`. Only on page 1 without a `status` filter; `type=gbp_audit` keeps only `gbp_report` rows, `type=reputation` only `review_insights`, other types none. Nothing is generated automatically: a PDF is made with `POST /reports`.

    "blocks": [

      { "kind": "unavailable", "title": "Reviews", "message": "Not available yet: this needs Google My Business v4 access." } ] } }
```

- Block kinds: `heading` (level 1 = a part of a Full report), `paragraph` (`muted`), `kpis`, `table` (`highlight` = row indexes, e.g. your business or a NAP mismatch), `line_chart`, `heatmap` (buckets `pack | visible | low | invisible | not_found | error`; text `60+` = not found, `!` = search failed), `list`, `unavailable`, `page_break`.
- `snapshot` and `document` are `null` until `ready`. The logo bytes are at `GET /organization/branding/logo` (current logo) and inside the PDF (the frozen one).

### `GET /api/v1/reports/:reportId/pdf`

`application/pdf`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="maple-leaf-plumbing-heating-gbp-audit-2026-09-27.pdf"`. **409** `{ reason: "not_ready" | "expired" }`.

### `POST /api/v1/reports/:reportId/email`

```json
{ "recipients": ["owner@mapleleafgroup.example"], "message": "Here is this month's report." }
```

→ `{ "sent": true, "recipients": 1, "delivery": "attachment" }` (`"link"` above `REPORT_EMAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENT_MB`, with a 30-day share link in the email). Sender: `"<email_sender_name>"` or `"<agency name> via MyPageSEO"` from the `EMAIL_FROM` address; `Reply-To` from branding. With `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=log` (the default outside production) the email is logged instead of sent and the answer is the same. **429** `rate_limited` above 20 per hour per organization.

### Share links

`POST /api/v1/reports/:reportId/share { "expires_in_days": 30 }` (1–365, or `null` / omitted for no expiry) → **201**:

```json
{ "share_id": "6ab8…", "url": "https://api.mypageseo.com/r/Qm9n…43 characters", "expires_at": "2026-10-27T05:44:53.600Z" }
```

The URL (token) is returned **only here**; only its SHA-256 is stored. `GET /reports/:id/shares` → `[{ share_id, purpose: "share"|"email_link", created_at, expires_at, revoked_at, active, views, last_viewed_at }]`; `DELETE /reports/:id/shares/:shareId` → `{ revoked: true }`.

**Public** `GET /r/<token>`: a branded HTML page (header with logo, KPIs, tables, SVG charts, "Download PDF"); `GET /r/<token>/pdf`: the PDF. `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, CSP `default-src 'none'` (no scripts), no internal ids. Unknown, revoked, expired or archived links give the same **404** page; **429** above 60 requests per minute per IP. The base URL comes from `SHARE_BASE_URL` (else `API_BASE_URL`).

### Scheduled reports (`/api/v1/report-schedules`)

```json
{ "scope": "client", "client_id": "6ab8ad2e7c446457a3999f8f", "type": "gbp_audit", "range": "28d",
  "recipients": ["owner@mapleleafgroup.example", "marketing@mapleleafgroup.example"] }
```

→ **201**:

```json
{ "schedule_id": "…", "scope": "client", "location_id": null, "client_id": "…", "type": "gbp_audit", "sections": ["score", "…"], "range": "28d",
  "recipients": ["owner@mapleleafgroup.example", "marketing@mapleleafgroup.example"], "frequency": "monthly", "status": "active",
  "locations": [ { "location_id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating" }, { "location_id": "…", "name": "Queen West Plumbing Co." } ],
  "next_expected": "2026-10-17T07:00:00.000Z", "last_sent_at": null, "last_error": null, "last_report_id": null, "created_at": "…" }
```

- **When:** once per monthly automatic refresh of each covered location, right after that location's GBP report is generated; the report is emailed when ready. A client schedule sends one email per location. Manual refreshes don't send.
- `next_expected`: the next monthly refresh of the covered location(s) (the email follows within minutes).
- **400**: `manual_only` (the location never refreshes automatically), `gbp_not_connected` (a GBP Audit schedule for an unbound location). **403** `agency_only` for client scope in a business organization. A failure later (e.g. a client location without GBP) is kept in `last_error`.
- `PATCH { status: "paused" | "active", recipients?, type?, sections?, range? }`; `DELETE` → `{ deleted: true }`. A client_user can read the schedules of its clients.

### Branding (`/api/v1/organization/branding`, white-label: agency only)

`GET` (any member):

```json
{ "white_label": true, "name": "Northern Local SEO", "agency_name": "Northern Local SEO", "primary_color": "#0f766e", "secondary_color": "#b45309",
  "footer_text": "Northern Local SEO · Toronto, ON", "contact_text": "hello@northernlocalseo.example · (416) 555-0199", "hide_mypageseo": true,
  "email_sender_name": "Northern Local SEO", "email_reply_to": "hello@northernlocalseo.example",
  "logo": { "mime": "image/png", "bytes": 559, "url": "/api/v1/organization/branding/logo" }, "updated_at": "…" }
```

A business organization gets `{ "white_label": false, "name": "MyPageSEO", "primary_color": "#1d4ed8", "secondary_color": "#0f766e", "hide_mypageseo": false, … }`.

- `PUT` (owner, agency): any of the fields above; colours `#rrggbb`; `""` clears a text field. **403** `agency_only` / `owner_only`.
- `PUT /logo { "data": "data:image/png;base64,…" }`: PNG or JPEG (checked by content), ≤ 512 KB. **400** `logo_type`, `logo_too_large`. `GET /logo` returns the image (private, not a public URL); `DELETE /logo` removes it.

## Ranking & data quality (Phase 12.5)

No new endpoints. What changed in the responses:

### Full depth and repeated sampling (rank-tracker, grid)

Every search now fetches all pages (up to 60 results). A point can be searched several times (`RANK_SAMPLES_PER_POINT`, default 1 until the variance test decides); its `rank`/`status` is the median of the samples. Each cell shows every sample:

```json
{ "rank": 4, "status": "ok", "bucket": "visible", "display": "4", "samples": [3, 5, 4], "spread": 2 }
```

`samples`: one value per sample (1–60, **61 = not in the top 60**, `null` = the search failed). `spread` = max − min (null with fewer than 2 values). Runs before Phase 12.5 have neither field. The full ordered list of place IDs at every point is stored (collection `rank_result_lists`) but not exposed by an endpoint yet.

`GET /locations/:id/rank-runs/:runId` adds `config: { samples, sample_spacing_sec, map_points }` and `expected_duration_ms`; `estimate` adds `samples` and `mapPoints`.

### `GET /locations/:locationId/map-ranking?keyword=&point=`

The named top 20 is fetched at the center **and** N, S, E, W (`MAP_RANKING_POINTS=all`). `point`: `C` (default), `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, or `all`.

```json
{ "run": { "…": "…" }, "names_stored": true, "point": "N", "points_available": ["C", "N", "S", "E", "W"],
  "keywords": [ { "keyword": "Emergency Plumber", "point": "N",
                  "results": [ { "rank": 1, "place_id": "ChIJ…", "name": "Riverdale Plumbing", "is_self": false, "target_key": null } ] } ],
  "attribution": { "provider": "Google", "text": "Google Maps" } }
```

**404** for a point the run doesn't have (runs before 12.5 have the center only). **400** for another value.

### Competitor rows (GBP report `competitors.rows`)

```json
{ "place_id": "ChIJ…", "name": "Riverdale Plumbing", "rating": 4.6, "user_rating_count": 212, "…": "…",
  "has_editorial_summary": true, "photo_count": 10, "photos_capped": true,
  "reviews": [ { "rating": 5, "text": "Came the same day…", "publish_time": "2026-09-12T14:03:00.000Z", "relative_time": "2 weeks ago",
                 "author": { "name": "Jordan T.", "uri": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/…" } } ],
  "recent_review_at": "2026-09-12T14:03:00.000Z" }
```

- Place Details now request `reviews`, `photos` and `editorialSummary` (Enterprise + Atmosphere SKU). `photo_count` is capped at 10 by Google: show "10+" when `photos_capped`. Review text is shown with its author (`author.name`, linked to `author.uri`).
- New insights: `photos_gap`, `review_freshness`. The editorial-summary part of the Public Score is now available for every business, so scores shift once.

### Attribution

Responses that carry Google Places content include `"attribution": { "provider": "Google", "text": "Google Maps" }`: map-ranking, competitor-suggestions, places/search, the GBP report, `GET /locations`, `GET /locations/:id/overview`, `GET /dashboard` and `GET /reports/:id`. Show the text near business names, ratings and reviews (wording: Google’s policy text “Google Maps”, Mohit 2026-09-27). PDFs and share pages print it under those tables and in the page footer.

### `GET /organization/usage` → `api_usage`

```json
{ "plan": { "…": "…" }, "locations": { "used": 3, "limit": 5 }, "keywords": { "used": 24, "limit": 60 }, "clients": { "used": 2 },
  "api_usage": { "month": "2026-09",
                 "by_sku": { "places.text.ids_only": 2610, "places.text.pro": 150, "places.details.enterprise_atmosphere": 18 },
                 "estimated_cost_usd": 5.25,
                 "previous_month": { "month": "2026-08", "by_sku": {}, "estimated_cost_usd": 0 },
                 "note": "Counts of Google API calls; cost at list prices before Google’s free monthly allowances." } }
```

Every Places and GBP call is counted per organization, location, month and billing SKU (`places.text.ids_only | pro | enterprise`, `places.details.essentials | pro | enterprise | enterprise_atmosphere`, `gbp.<api>`). These are counts, not limits; per-location detail: `npm run cost:report` (OPERATIONS.md).

### Reports

Rank Tracker reports gain the section `map_ranking` ("Who ranks across the area": the top 5 at the 5 points, with your rank at each). Competitor Analysis gains `reviews` ("What customers say": up to 2 recent reviews per business with the author) and a Photos column.

## Platform admin authentication (Phase 10)

Admin endpoints (`/admin/*`, and the admin-only routes listed with `admin (permission)` in [ENDPOINTS.md](ENDPOINTS.md)) take an **admin session token**:

```http
POST /api/v1/admin/auth/login
{ "email": "admin@example.com", "password": "…" }
→ { "admin": { "id": "…", "name": "…", "email": "admin@example.com", "role_id": 1, "role_name": "Super Admin", "permissions": ["admins.manage", "…"], "is_active": true, "password_set": true, "last_login_at": "…", "created_at": "…" }, "token": "eyJ…" }
Authorization: Bearer eyJ…
```

- **Sign-in errors** (`POST /admin/auth/login`): every credential failure is the same **400** "Invalid email or password." with no `reason`: wrong email or password, a deactivated admin, an admin whose password isn't set yet (set-password link pending), or a deactivated role. That's deliberate (no account enumeration), so show one "wrong email or password" message for any 400. A malformed body (missing email / password) is also 400, with a validation message. **429** `rate_limited` `{ retry_after_seconds }` after 10 attempts per email + IP in 15 minutes. Never 401 or 403.
- **`GET /admin/auth/me`** returns the admin object itself (the same object as `admin` in the sign-in response, **not** wrapped): `{ id, name, email, role_id, role_name, permissions, is_active, password_set, last_login_at, created_at }`. A missing, invalid, expired or revoked token (e.g. after deactivation) → **401**.
- **Token:** HS256, signed with `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, audience `mps-admin`, valid 12 hours. User tokens never work on admin routes, and the reverse.
- **Passwords by link (13b, no OTP):** the admin panel has one page, `ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL/reset-password?token=…`, which posts `POST /admin/auth/reset-password { token, password, confirm_password }` (errors as for users: `link_invalid`, `link_expired`, `passwords_do_not_match`). Two links lead there:
  - **Forgot password:** `POST /admin/auth/forgot-password { email }` → `{ reset: "sent_if_account_exists" }` (same answer for any email); the link is valid 60 minutes.
  - **New admin:** `POST /admin/admins { name, email, role_id }` creates the account **without a password** and emails a set-password link (72 h, `ADMIN_SET_PASSWORD_TTL_HOURS`); `POST /admin/admins/:adminId/password-link` sends a new one. Until the password is set the admin can't sign in (`password_set: false`).
  - **Password chosen by the super admin (2026-10-05):** `POST /admin/admins { name, email, role_id, password, confirm_password }` stores it and sends no link (`password_set: true, password_link_sent: false`; audit note "password set by admin"). For an existing employee: `POST /admin/admins/:adminId/password { password, confirm_password }` → the admin view; pending links stop working and their sessions end. **400** `passwords_do_not_match`; **403** `own_account` (use change-password). Password rule: 8–128 characters with a letter and a digit.
- **Change password:** `POST /admin/auth/change-password { current_password, new_password, confirm_password }` → `{ changed: true, token }` (continue with the new token). **400** `wrong_password`, `passwords_do_not_match`.
- **Revocation:** a password change or reset, a role or email change, or deactivation (`PATCH /admin/admins/:adminId { is_active: false }`) ends all earlier sessions of that admin. Admins are never deleted.
- **Admin accounts** (`admins.manage`): `GET /admin/admins?active=`, `GET/PATCH /admin/admins/:adminId`. `PATCH` takes any of `name, email, role_id, is_active`; **403** `own_role`, `own_account`, `last_super_admin`; **409** `email_taken`; **400** `invalid_role`. Every change is in the audit log (`admin.create`, `admin.update`, `admin.password_link`).
- **Permissions:**

| Permission | Roles |
|---|---|
| `admins.manage` | super admin |
| `platform.read` | super admin, admin |
| `platform.write` | super admin, admin |
| `content.manage` | super admin, admin, editor |
| `citations.view` (Phase 16) | super admin, admin, editor |
| `citations.manage` (Phase 16) | super admin, admin, editor |
| `billing.read`, `billing.manage` (Phase 13a) | super admin, admin |
| `support.read`, `support.manage` (Phase 13b) | super admin, admin, editor |
| `audits.run` (Phase 19) | super admin, admin, sales representative |

- **Errors:** no or invalid token → **401**; a missing permission → **403**: `{ "reason": "forbidden", "permission": "platform.read" }`. Rate limits → **429** `rate_limited`.

**Other Phase 10 changes clients see:**
- A bad, expired or revoked **user** token is **401** (it used to be 500 for a bad signature, 404 for a deleted user). Access tokens last 1 day; refresh as in "Session tokens and refresh" above (refresh tokens last 30 days, then sign in again).
- Password changes and resets end every session of that user.
- Any request key starting with `$` or containing `.` → **400** `{ "reason": "invalid_input", "field": "body.email.$ne" }`.
- Request bodies are limited to 1 MB (**413**). Multipart requests: files only on the upload routes (blog create/update, GBP post add); elsewhere a file → **400**.
- 500 responses say "Something went wrong." (details only in development).

### `GET /api/v1/admin/roles` (Phase 13b, `admins.manage`)

The fixed admin roles and what each may do (for the role picker when creating an admin):

```json
[
  { "role_id": 1, "key": "superAdmin", "name": "Super Admin", "active": true, "permissions": ["admins.manage", "platform.read", "platform.write", "content.manage", "citations.view", "citations.manage", "billing.read", "billing.manage"] },

Roles can't be created, edited or deleted (the legacy `/roles` CRUD was removed in 13b: a new role never had any permission).

## Citations (Phase 16)

**Manual, admin-managed citation tracking.** Platform admins keep a **master list of directories**, put directories on each location's **citation list**, and record what they find: status, listing URL, NAP as seen. Organization users get a read-only dashboard, a table and a **Citation Health** score, plus a Citation Report in the Reports center. There are no external citation APIs and no Google calls.

**Admin routes** (`/api/v1/admin/citations/*`) take a platform-admin token (see "Platform admin authentication"):
- `citations.view` to read; `citations.manage` to change. Both are held by super admin, admin and editor.
- Errors carry `data.reason`. Every catalogue row is in [ENDPOINTS.md](ENDPOINTS.md).

### Directories and categories (admin)

A **directory**:

```json
{ "id": "…", "name": "HomeStars", "url": "https://homestars.com/", "domain": "homestars.com", "type": "niche",
  "categories": [ { "id": "…", "name": "Home services", "slug": "home-services" } ],
  "countries": ["CA"], "regions": [], "authority": 60, "notes": null, "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2026-09-27T…", "updated_at": "2026-09-27T…" }
```

**Fields:**
- **`type`:** `general | niche | aggregator | social | government_chamber`.
- **`countries`:** `US` and / or `CA` (at least one).
- **`categories`:** empty = fits every business. A `niche` directory needs at least one.
- **`regions`:** optional 2-letter state / province codes. They limit the directory to part of a country, e.g. a state chamber.
- **`authority`:** 0–100 or null (optional; weights the score).
- **`domain`:** unique, taken from `url` without `www.`.

**Writes:**
- **Create:** `POST /admin/citations/directories { name, url, type, countries, category_ids?, regions?, authority?, notes?, is_active? }` → **201**.
- **Errors:** **400** `{ reason: "invalid_directory", problems: [{ field, message }] }`; **409** `{ reason: "domain_taken", domain }`.
- **Delete:** deactivates the directory. Entries that use it keep it, and it is no longer suggested.

A **directory category** is an industry group mapped to the Google business categories (`GET /admin/citations/business-categories?q=plumb` → `[{ id, name }]`):

```json
{ "id": "…", "name": "Home services", "slug": "home-services", "is_active": true,
  "business_categories": [ { "id": "…", "name": "Plumber" }, { "id": "…", "name": "Electrician" } ], "directory_count": 6 }
```

A category can't be deleted while directories use it: **409** `{ reason: "in_use", directory_count }`. Deactivate it instead.

### Directory CSV import / export (admin)

`GET /admin/citations/directories/export` downloads `citation-directories-<date>.csv`: UTF-8 with a BOM, so Excel reads accents correctly.

```csv
name,url,type,countries,categories,regions,authority,notes,active
Angi,https://www.angi.com/,niche,US,home-services,,85,,true
Texas Chamber Directory,https://example-chamber.org/,government_chamber,US,,TX,40,Region-limited example,true
Yelp,https://www.yelp.com/,general,US|CA,,,93,,true
```

`POST /admin/citations/directories/import?dry_run=true` takes the file as the body, with `Content-Type: text/csv` (≤ 1 MB, ≤ 2,000 rows).
- The header is required; columns can come in any order. `name, url, type, countries` are required columns.
- **Lists** are separated by `|`. **Categories** are directory-category **slugs**.
- **Upsert key:** the domain of `url`. A file row with a known domain updates that directory; a new domain creates one.
- Directories that are **not** in the file are left alone (never deleted).
- **All-or-nothing:** any row error → **422** and nothing is applied. `dry_run=true` validates and counts without writing.

```json
{ "dry_run": false, "applied": true, "rows": 42, "created": 40, "updated": 1, "unchanged": 1, "errors": [] }
```

A failed import:

```json
{ "dry_run": false, "applied": false, "rows": 3, "created": 2, "updated": 0, "unchanged": 1,
  "errors": [ { "row": 3, "field": "categories", "message": "unknown category \"lawyers\"" },
              { "row": 4, "field": "url", "message": "duplicate domain \"yelp.com\" (also on line 2)" } ] }
```

**Row rules:**

| Column | Rule |
|---|---|
| name | 1–120 characters |
| url | http(s) URL ≤ 300; unique domain within the file |
| type | one of the 5 types |
| countries | `US`, `CA` or `US\|CA` |
| categories | existing slugs; required for `niche` |
| regions | 2-letter codes valid for the listed countries |
| authority | empty or an integer 0–100 |
| active | `true`, `false` or empty (= true) |

**Other errors:**
- File-level problems → **400** with `invalid_csv` (unreadable), `invalid_csv_header` (`missing` / `unknown` columns), `empty_csv` or `too_many_rows`.
- **Export safety:** cells starting with `= + - @` are prefixed with `'`, so a spreadsheet never runs them as formulas. Re-importing such a cell keeps the `'`.

### Finding a location (admin, follow-up 2026-10-08)

`GET /admin/citations/locations?q=&organization_id=&client_id=&country=US|CA&list=has|none&sort=name|score|checked&page=&limit=` lists **every live location** with its citation summary, so an admin can open any location's list. The work queue only shows locations with unchecked entries; this index also shows a location that was never given a list, or one where everything has been checked.

```json
{ "locations": [
    { "location": { "id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "city": "Toronto", "country": "Canada",
                    "organization": { "id": "…", "name": "Pat Agency" }, "client": { "id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf" } },
      "citations": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "coverage": 0.83, "total": 6,
                     "counts": { "not_checked": 1, "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "not_found": 1, "duplicate": 0, "submitted": 1, "pending": 0, "removed": 0 },
                     "last_checked_at": "2026-09-27T…" } },
    { "location": { "id": "…", "name": "Austin Plumbing", "city": "Austin", "country": "United States", "organization": { "id": "…", "name": "Lone Star Co" }, "client": null },
      "citations": null } ],
  "page": 1, "limit": 50, "total": 2 }
```

- **`citations: null`:** the location has no citation list yet. Open it (`GET …/locations/:locationId`) and run suggest.
- **`q`** matches the name or city. **`list=none`** gives locations without a list; **`list=has`** gives those with one.
- **Sorts:** `name` (default); `score` (lowest first, locations without a list last); `checked` (least recently checked first).
- The numbers come from the location summary, which every citation change keeps up to date.

### A location's citation list (admin)

`GET /admin/citations/locations/:locationId` is the admin screen for one location:

```json
{ "location": { "id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "city": "Toronto", "state": "Ontario", "country": "Canada",
                "organization": { "id": "…", "name": "Pat Agency", "type": "agency" }, "client": { "id": "…", "name": "Maple Leaf" },
                "nap": { "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing & Heating", "address": "100 Queen St E", "phone": "4165550100", "website": "https://example.test" } },
  "business_categories": ["Plumber"], "category_groups": [ { "id": "…", "name": "Home services" } ], "category_matched": true,
  "health": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "coverage": 0.83, "scored": 5, "total": 6,
              "counts": { "not_checked": 1, "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "not_found": 1, "duplicate": 0, "submitted": 1, "pending": 0, "removed": 0 } },
  "entries": [ {
      "id": "…", "directory": { "id": "…", "name": "Data Axle", "url": "https://www.data-axle.com/", "domain": "data-axle.com", "type": "aggregator", "authority": 80, "is_active": true },
      "status": "nap_wrong", "listing_url": "https://…", "nap_found": { "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing and Heating", "address": "100 Queen Street East", "phone": "(416) 555-0199", "website": null },
      "mismatch_fields": ["phone"], "notes": null, "last_checked_at": "2026-09-27T…", "checked_by": "<admin id>", "source": "suggested", "active": true } ],
  "removed_from_list": [] }
```

- **`nap`:** the NAP a listing should show (the location's own name, address, phone, website).
- **`category_matched: false`:** none of the location's business categories (stored category + GBP primary / additional) is in a directory category, so only directories without categories are suggested.

**Suggestions:** `POST …/suggest[?dry_run=true]` adds, as `not_checked`, every **active** directory that:
- lists the location's country (US / CA),
- fits its state / province when the directory has `regions`, and
- has no categories, or shares a category group with the location.

It never removes anything and never re-adds a directory an admin took off the list.
- It also runs **automatically when onboarding completes** (`POST /onboarding/complete`); a failure there never blocks completion.
- Locations outside the US / CA get `reason: "unsupported_country"` and nothing is added.

**Recording a check:** `PATCH /admin/citations/entries/:entryId`:

```json
{ "status": "nap_wrong", "listing_url": "https://www.data-axle.com/biz/123",
  "nap_found": { "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing and Heating", "address": "100 Queen Street East", "phone": "(416) 555-0199" },
  "note": "old phone number" }
```

→ `{ "entry": { …, "mismatch_fields": ["phone"], "last_checked_at": "…" }, "changed": ["status", "listing_url", "nap_found"] }`

- **Statuses:** `not_checked | live_correct | nap_wrong | not_found | duplicate | submitted | pending | removed`. `removed` = the listing itself was taken down.
- **`mismatch_fields`** is computed on the server after normalising:
  - **name:** case, punctuation, `&` = "and"
  - **address:** street line with abbreviations (Street = St), ZIP / postal code
  - **phone:** the last 10 digits
  - **website:** the host without `www.`

  A field missing on either side is not compared.
- **`live_correct` with a mismatch** → **409** `{ "reason": "nap_mismatch", "mismatch_fields": ["phone"] }`. Use `nap_wrong`, or send `"confirm": true`.
- **`checked: true`** alone records "checked, no change". A change of status, NAP or URL also sets `last_checked_at` / `checked_by`; notes alone don't.
- **Every change** writes one history row (`GET …/entries/:entryId/history`) and refreshes the location's Citation Health.

**Bulk:** `POST /admin/citations/entries/bulk { entry_ids, status, note? }` → `{ updated, unchanged, skipped: [{ entry_id, reason }] }`. Entries whose NAP differs are skipped for `live_correct` (`nap_mismatch`).

**Taking a directory off a list:** `DELETE /admin/citations/entries/:entryId` (restore: `POST …/restore`). The entry and its history are kept, and it stops counting in the score.

### Work queue (admin)

| Queue | What it lists | Sort |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /admin/citations/queue/unchecked` | locations with `not_checked` entries: `unchecked`, `active_entries`, `oldest_added_at` | waiting longest first |
| `GET /admin/citations/queue/stale?days=90` | checked entries not checked again for N days (default `CITATION_STALE_DAYS` = 90), with `days_since_check` | oldest check first |
| `GET /admin/citations/queue/recent?days=7` | history rows of the last N days, with directory and location | newest first |

**Filters** on all three: `organization_id`, `client_id`, `directory_id`, `type`, plus `status` on `stale` and `recent` (on `recent` it is the new status); `page`, `limit` (≤ 100). Each row carries `location: { id, name, city, organization: { id, name }, client }`. Deleted locations and entries taken off a list are left out.

### Citations for organization users (read-only)

`GET /locations/:locationId/citations[?status=]`. Access is membership of the location's organization; a client_user sees only its clients' locations. Another organization's location → **404**.

```json
{ "available": true,
  "health": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "coverage": 0.83, "total": 6 },
  "counts": { "not_checked": 1, "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "not_found": 1, "duplicate": 0, "submitted": 1, "pending": 0, "removed": 0 },
  "last_checked_at": "2026-09-27T…",
  "recent_changes": [ { "at": "2026-09-27T…", "directory": { "name": "Data Axle", "type": "aggregator" }, "action": "status_changed",
                        "from": "not_checked", "to": "nap_wrong", "changed_fields": ["status", "nap_found"], "by": "MyPageSEO team" } ],
  "citations": [
    { "directory": { "name": "Data Axle", "url": "https://www.data-axle.com/", "type": "aggregator" }, "status": "nap_wrong",
      "nap_issues": [ { "field": "phone", "found": "(416) 555-0199", "expected": "4165550100" } ],
      "listing_url": "https://…", "last_checked_at": "2026-09-27T…" },
    { "directory": { "name": "Yelp", "url": "https://www.yelp.com/", "type": "general" }, "status": "live_correct", "nap_issues": [], "listing_url": "https://…", "last_checked_at": "…" } ] }
```

- **Row order:** problems first: `nap_wrong`, `duplicate`, `not_found`, `pending`, `submitted`, `not_checked`, `live_correct`.
- **Hidden from customers:** admin names and ids, and internal notes. Every change reads "MyPageSEO team".
- **No list yet:** `{ "available": false, "reason": "no_citations_yet" }`. The list is created when onboarding completes, or by an admin.
- **History:** `GET /locations/:locationId/citations/changes?page=&limit=` returns the same change rows, paginated (notes-only edits are not listed).

**Dashboard** (`GET /dashboard`, Phase 16 additions):
- **Business shape:** a `citations` block and `locations[].citation_score`.
- **Agency shape:** `portfolio.avg_citation_score`, the `citations` block and `table.rows[].citations: { score, grade, nap_wrong }`.

```json
"citations": { "available": true, "score": 50, "grade": "D", "coverage": 0.83, "listings": 6,
               "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "not_found": 1, "not_checked": 1 }
```

- **Not available:** `{ "available": false, "reason": "no_citations_yet" | "not_checked_yet" }`.
- **Recommended actions** gain `citations:nap_wrong` ("N listings show the wrong name, address or phone") and `citations:not_found` ("Not listed on N directories"), with `source: "citations"`.

### Citation Report (Reports center)

`POST /reports { location_id, type: "citation", sections?, range? }` works like the other types. Its PDF, email, share link and monthly schedule behave the same (`type: "citation"` in `POST /report-schedules`).
- **Sections:** `score`, `table`, `nap_issues`, `changes` (the changes within `range`: 28d, 90d or 12m).
- **No list yet:** a location without a citation list → **400** `{ "reason": "no_citations_yet" }`.
- **Full report:** has a fourth part, **Citations**. It shows "No citations have been tracked for this location yet." when the list is empty.
- **Snapshot:** holds our own data only: directory names, statuses, the NAP as recorded, change dates. No admin names, no internal notes and no Google content, so the Citation Report carries no Google attribution.

```json
"citation": { "available": true, "as_of": "2026-09-27T…", "range": "28d",
  "score": { "score": 50, "grade": "D", "coverage": 0.83, "total": 6, "counts": { "live_correct": 2, "nap_wrong": 1, "…": 0 } },
  "nap_issues": { "expected": { "name": "…", "address": "…", "phone": "4165550100", "website": "…" },
                  "rows": [ { "directory": "Data Axle", "field": "phone", "found": "(416) 555-0199", "expected": "4165550100" } ] },
  "table": [ { "directory": "Data Axle", "type": "aggregator", "status": "nap_wrong", "listing_url": "https://…", "last_checked_at": "…", "nap_issues": ["phone"] } ],
  "changes": [ { "at": "…", "directory": "Data Axle", "action": "status_changed", "from": "not_checked", "to": "nap_wrong" } ] }
```


## Billing (Phase 13a)

One billing page. Money is in the organization's currency (US → USD, CA → CAD); monthly = first-location price + (n − 1) × additional-location price, n = paid locations (standard plan: up to 20). Read: owner and member; payments and changes: owner. Billing stays open when the organization is read-only. Catalogue: ENDPOINTS.md #107–#121.

**PayPal flow for the frontend:**
1. `POST /billing/checkout` (subscription), `POST /billing/location-slots` or `POST /billing/tokens/checkout` (one-time orders) → `approve_url`. Send the browser there.
2. PayPal returns to `FRONTEND_URL/settings/billing?…`:
   - subscription: `?checkout=success&subscription_id=…` (or `checkout=cancelled`) → call `POST /billing/sync`
   - order: `?order=return&purpose=token_pack|location_slots&token=<PayPal order id>` (or `order=cancelled`) → call `POST /billing/orders/<token>/capture`
3. The webhooks do the same work, so a closed tab still ends up paid; both paths are idempotent.

### `GET /api/v1/billing`

```json
{
  "state": "active",
  "read_only": false,
  "trial_ends_at": "2026-10-05T10:00:00.000Z",
  "grace_ends_at": null,
  "currency": "CAD",
  "plan": { "id": "…", "name": "Standard", "kind": "standard", "max_locations": 20, "users_per_location": 3 },
  "prices": {
    "current": { "first_location": 49, "additional_location": 19 },
    "upcoming": { "first_location": 55, "additional_location": 19, "effective_from": "2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }
  },
  "subscription": {
    "id": "…", "status": "active", "billing_method": "paypal", "paid_quantity": 3,
    "price": { "first_location": 49, "additional_location": 19 },
    "current_period_start": "2026-09-28T…", "current_period_end": "2026-10-28T…",
    "cancel_at_period_end": false, "comp_until": null
  },
  "next_renewal": { "date": "2026-10-28T…", "quantity": 3, "amount": 87, "fixed": false },
  "locations": { "active": 3, "allowed": 3, "max": 20 },
  "users": { "used": 4, "limit": 9 },
  "tokens": { "balance": 12, "cost_per_refresh": { "rankings": 1, "gbp": 1 }, "monthly_grant": 10, "last_grant_at": "2026-09-01T03:00:00.000Z", "next_grant_at": "2026-10-01T03:00:00.000Z" },
  "billing_details": { "name": "Maple Leaf Inc.", "email": null, "address_line1": null, "address_line2": null, "city": "Toronto", "region": "ON", "postal_code": null, "country": "Canada" },
  "online_payments": true
}
```

- `state`: `trialing | active | past_due | inactive | suspended_by_admin`. `past_due` keeps full access until `grace_ends_at` (7 days); `inactive` and `suspended_by_admin` are read-only.
- `next_renewal.fixed`: the amount was fixed by the renewal snapshot (11 days before the renewal); before that it is an estimate from the active locations and the price in effect at the renewal date. `null` when cancelled, comped or without a subscription.
- A cancelled subscription keeps `state: "active"` until `current_period_end`.
- `online_payments: false` → PayPal isn't configured (checkout answers 503 `billing_not_configured`).

### `POST /api/v1/billing/checkout`

Body (13c): `{ "quantity": 3 }`, the number of locations to pay for, from 1 to the plan's location cap (20 on the standard plan) and at least the active locations. Without it: the active locations (at least 1). A trial user who wants several locations subscribes for all of them with one PayPal approval. The PayPal price is first + (quantity − 1) × additional, and the first invoice shows the quantity ("First location" 1, "Additional locations" quantity − 1). → **201**

```json
{ "subscription_id": "…", "approve_url": "https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/subscriptions?ba_token=…", "quantity": 2, "currency": "CAD", "monthly_amount": 68, "starts_at": null }
```

`starts_at` is set when a cancelled subscription is still paid: the new one starts when that period ends. Errors: **409** `price_not_set` (prices not set yet), `already_subscribed`, `manual_billing` (billed by invoice); **403** `enterprise_required` (a quantity above the plan's cap); **400** `{ "reason": "quantity_below_active", "active": 2 }`; **503** `billing_not_configured`.

### `POST /api/v1/billing/sync`, `POST /api/v1/billing/cancel`

`sync` re-reads the subscription at PayPal and returns the `GET /billing` body. `cancel { reason? }` cancels at PayPal and returns the `GET /billing` body (access continues to the end of the paid period); **409** `no_subscription`, `manual_billing`.

### Location slots

When `POST /locations` or `POST /gbp/picks/:pickId/bind` answers **402** `location_payment_required` (with a `quote`), the organization is at its paid quantity:

`GET /api/v1/billing/location-slots/quote?quantity=1` →

```json
{
  "quantity": 1, "remaining_days": 12.5, "period_days": 30,
  "lines": [{ "label": "Additional location, prorated to 2026-10-28", "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 7.92, "amount": 7.92 }],
  "amount": 7.92, "currency": "CAD", "period_end": "2026-10-28T…",
  "billing_method": "paypal", "paid_quantity": 3, "new_paid_quantity": 4
}
```

Extra slots are always charged at the additional-location price, prorated to the period end. Within 11 days of the renewal the renewal amount is already fixed, so a second line adds the full next period for the slots. `POST /api/v1/billing/location-slots { "quantity": 1 }` → **201** `{ order_id, provider_order_id, approve_url, amount, currency, fulfilled: false, quote }`. After the capture, retry the location add. Manual billing: **200** `{ fulfilled: true, quote }` (the slot is available now; the prorated line goes on the next invoice). **402** `subscription_required` without an active subscription; **403** `enterprise_required` `{ max }` beyond the plan cap.

Removing a location refunds nothing; the slot stays paid and reusable until the period ends, and the renewal counts the active locations.

### Tokens

Manual refreshes cost tokens (`tokens.cost_per_refresh`); the monthly automatic refresh is free.

**Monthly token grant (2026-10-01):** `tokens.monthly_grant` is the plan's grant per paid period (0 on the standard plan; custom plans can set one). It is added at each period start (`last_grant_at`); `next_grant_at` is the current period end while the subscription is active (else `null`). The token bar can show e.g. "9 of 10 this month" from the balance and `monthly_grant`.
- `GET /api/v1/billing/token-packs` → `{ currency, packs: [{ id, name, tokens, currency, list_price, price, expires_after_days }] }` (`price` includes a custom plan's pack price or discount).
- `POST /api/v1/billing/coupon/validate { pack_id, coupon_code }` → `{ pack_id, currency, price, discount, total }`.
- `POST /api/v1/billing/tokens/checkout { pack_id, coupon_code? }` → **201** `{ order_id, provider_order_id, approve_url, amount, currency, fulfilled: false }`. A 100% coupon fulfils at once (**200**, `fulfilled: true`).
- Coupon errors (**400**): `invalid_coupon`, `coupon_expired`, `coupon_exhausted`, `coupon_not_applicable`. **404** `pack_not_found`.
- `GET /api/v1/billing/tokens/ledger?page=&limit=` →

```json
{
  "balance": 9,
  "entries": [
    { "id": "…", "type": "spend", "amount": -1, "balance_after": 9, "ref": "rank_run:…", "location_id": "…", "note": "Manual rankings refresh", "by": "user", "at": "…" },
    { "id": "…", "type": "purchase", "amount": 10, "balance_after": 10, "ref": "order:…", "location_id": null, "note": "10 tokens", "by": "system", "at": "…" }
  ],
  "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 2
}
```

Ledger types: `purchase | spend | refund | grant | monthly_grant | adjustment | expiry`; `by` is `user`, `system` or `MyPageSEO team`.

### `POST /api/v1/billing/orders/:orderId/capture`

`:orderId` is PayPal's order id (the `token` query parameter of the return URL). → `{ status: "captured" | "pending", order_id, purpose, billing: <GET /billing> }`. Idempotent. **409** `order_not_approved` (the buyer hasn't approved yet), `order_closed`; **402** `payment_declined`; **404** `order_not_found`.

### Invoices and billing details

- `GET /api/v1/billing/invoices?page=&limit=` → `{ invoices: [{ id, number: "INV-2026-000042", kind: subscription|location_slots|token_pack|manual, status: open|paid|refunded|void, currency, lines: [{ label, quantity, unit_price, amount }], tax_lines: [], total, charged_amount, period_start, period_end, issued_at, due_at, paid_at, has_pdf }], page, limit, total }`
- `GET /api/v1/billing/invoices/:invoiceId/pdf` → `application/pdf`
- `PATCH /api/v1/billing/details` with any of `{ name, email, address_line1, address_line2, city, region, postal_code, country }` → the saved details. They print on the next invoices; issued invoices keep the details of their issue date.

### `GET /api/v1/pricing?country=US|CA` (public)

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "prices": { "current": { "first_location": 39, "additional_location": 15 }, "upcoming": null },
  "max_locations": 20,
  "users_per_location": 3,
  "trial": { "days": 7, "locations": 1, "users": 3 },
  "tokens_per_refresh": { "rankings": 1, "gbp": 1 },
  "token_packs": [{ "id": "…", "name": "Starter", "tokens": 10, "price": 20, "currency": "USD" }]
}
```

`prices.current` is `null` until prices are set. (The amounts above are examples only; real prices are set by an admin.)

## Billing admin (Phase 13a)

`/api/v1/admin/billing/*`, platform admins with `billing.read` (GET) / `billing.manage` (changes): super admin and admin. Every change is written to the audit log (`GET /admin/billing/audit`: who, when, before → after). Catalogue: ENDPOINTS.md #122–#151.

**Prices.** `POST /admin/billing/plans/:planId/prices`:

```json
{ "currency": "USD", "first_location_price": 39, "additional_location_price": 15, "effective_from": "2026-11-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

- A price applies from each organization's first renewal on or after `effective_from`: the renewal snapshot (11 days before a renewal) uses the price in effect at the renewal date.
- History is kept. Posting the same currency and date replaces that entry; a date before today is refused (`effective_from_in_past`).
- Until the standard plan has a price for a currency, checkout in that currency answers 409 `price_not_set`.

**Enterprise (custom plans).**
1. `POST /admin/billing/organizations/:organizationId/custom-plan` with any plan settings, e.g. `{ "max_locations": null, "users_per_location": 5, "monthly_token_grant": 20, "token_pack_discount_percent": 15, "billing_method": "manual" }`. It is copied from the standard plan and starts without prices.
2. Add its prices with `POST /admin/billing/plans/<custom plan id>/prices`.
3. For invoice billing: `POST /admin/billing/organizations/:organizationId/manual-subscription { "quantity": 30, "comp_until"?: "…" }`.
   - The first period is invoiced at once (open, due in `MANUAL_INVOICE_DUE_DAYS`); `billing-renewals` invoices each later period.
   - Record payments with `POST /admin/billing/invoices/:invoiceId/payments { "note": "wire 4411" }`.
   - An invoice unpaid 7 days after its due date makes the organization read-only until it is paid (or voided).
4. PayPal custom prices need nothing more: the organization checks out as usual and its subscription carries the custom amount.
5. `DELETE …/custom-plan` puts the organization back on the standard plan (its next renewal uses the standard prices).

**Comp / trial / tokens.**
- A manual subscription with `comp_until` is free until that date (no invoices).
- Trial extension: `PATCH /api/v1/admin/organizations/:organizationId/trial { "trial_ends_at": "…" }` (admin panel, 13b).
- `POST …/organizations/:organizationId/tokens { "amount": 5, "type": "grant", "note": "goodwill" }` (negative `adjustment`s can't take the balance below zero).


## Admin panel (Phase 13b)

`/api/v1/admin/*`, platform admins. Catalogue: ENDPOINTS.md "Admin panel (Phase 13b)". Every change is written to the audit log (actions `admin.user.*`, `admin.organization.*`).

**`GET /admin/overview`**

```json
{
  "organizations": { "total": 42, "by_type": { "business": 30, "agency": 12 }, "by_state": { "trialing": 9, "active": 28, "past_due": 2, "inactive": 3 } },
  "subscriptions": { "paying": 30, "past_due": 2, "mrr": { "USD": 2140, "CAD": 890 } },
  "trials_ending_7d": 4,
  "token_sales_30d": { "USD": { "count": 6, "total": 120 } },
  "signups_30d": { "users": 18, "organizations": 11 },
  "open_tickets": 5,
  "generated_at": "…"
}
```

MRR = what each open paid subscription charges per month (first + (paid − 1) × additional); comped subscriptions are excluded.

**Users.**
- `GET /admin/users?q=&status=active|disabled|unverified&type=business|agency&role=owner|member|client_user&organization_id=&page=&limit=` → `{ users: [{ id, email, name, user_type, status, disabled, email_verified_at, created_at, last_login_at, organizations, organization: { id, name, type, role } | null }], page, limit, total }`. `type` / `role` / `organization_id` (2026-10-05) match users with an **active membership** of that kind, so `type=agency&role=owner` is the agency account holders and `type=agency&role=member` their staff. `organization` is the user's first active membership (owner first).
- `POST /admin/users` (2026-10-05, `platform.write`) creates a customer account, **verified**, with no usable password; a set-password link (`FRONTEND_URL/reset-password?token=…`, 72 h, `ADMIN_SET_PASSWORD_TTL_HOURS`) is emailed unless `send_email: false`. Two body shapes:
  - a new organization it owns: `{ "email": "…", "name": "Nia", "account_type": "business" | "agency", "organization_name": "Nia Bakery", "country": "US" | "CA" }` (the trial starts as at signup);
  - a staff member of an existing organization: `{ "email": "…", "name": "Sam", "organization_id": "…", "role": "member" | "client_user", "client_ids"?: ["…"] }` (`client_user` only in agencies; an existing account just gets the membership). Plan user limits don't apply.

  → **201** `{ user: <GET /admin/users/:userId>, organization_id, role, new_account, password_email_sent }`. Errors: **409** `email_taken` (new organization with a used email), `already_member`; **404** `organization_not_found`; **400** `agency_only`, `invalid_clients`, `invalid_input`.
- `DELETE /admin/users/:userId { reason }` (2026-10-05, `platform.write`) hard-deletes the user (the email can sign up again): Google connections disconnected (their locations stay, without GBP), memberships, sessions, links and profile removed; owned organizations with nothing in them are deleted too. → `{ deleted: true, id, organizations_deleted: [{ id, name }] }`. **409** `owns_organization` `{ organizations: [{ id, name, other_members, locations, open_subscription }] }` while an owned organization is in use (suspend it instead, or empty it first).
- `GET /admin/users/:userId` adds `mobile`, `memberships: [{ organization_id, organization, type, role, status }]`, `recent_logins: [{ at, logged_out_at, ip }]` (last 10) and `google_connections: [{ google_email, status }]`.
- `POST …/disable { reason }` blocks sign-in and ends every session; `POST …/enable`; `POST …/logout` ends every session; `POST …/resend-verification`, `POST …/verify` (**409** `already_verified`).

**Users: edit and membership (2026-10-05).**
- `PATCH /admin/users/:userId { name?, email?, mobile? }` → the user detail. A new email must be free (**409** `email_taken`); it stays verified and every session ends. Audit `admin.user.update`.
- A user created with `send_email: false` (or who lost the email) signs in through the customer app's normal **Forgot password** (`POST /auth/forgot-password`): the account is active, verified and `ACCEPTED`.

**Organizations.**
- `GET /admin/organizations?q=&type=&state=&plan=standard|custom&trial_ending_days=` → `{ organizations: [{ id, name, type, country, owner_email, plan, state, trial_ends_at, locations: { used, allowed, max }, users: { used, limit }, token_balance, suspended_at, created_at }], page, limit, total }`.
- `GET /admin/organizations/:organizationId` → `{ organization: { …, owner, suspended_at, suspended_reason, limit_overrides }, members, locations, clients, billing: <GET /billing>, invoices, citations: { <status>: count } }`.
- `POST …/suspend { reason }`: the organization becomes read-only. Money-costing actions (and adding locations or inviting) answer **403** `organization_suspended` (13c; 402 is only for payment situations); reads keep working. **409** `already_suspended`. `POST …/unsuspend { note? }` (**409** `not_suspended`).
- `PATCH …/trial { trial_ends_at }`.
- `GET …/clients` (2026-10-05) → `[{ id, name, is_active, locations }]`: an agency's clients, for `client_ids` when creating a `client_user`.
- `DELETE …/members/:userId { reason }` (2026-10-05): removes the user from this organization only (membership `removed`, their default organization moves to another one); the account and its other memberships stay. → the organization detail. **403** `owner_protected`; **404** `not_found`. Audit `admin.organization.member_remove`.
- `PATCH …/limits { max_locations?: number | null, extra_users?: number, free_locations?: number }`: overrides on top of the plan. `max_locations: null` = no cap; `extra_users` is added to the pooled user limit; `free_locations` (2026-10-05) adds locations on top of the paid (or trial) quantity that are **never billed** (renewals and checkout charge the active locations minus these; `GET /billing` → `locations.free`). The body replaces the whole override object, so send every field you want to keep; `{}` clears them.

**Reports (2026-10-05, `platform.read`).**
- `GET /admin/reports?organization_id=&location_id=&type=&status=queued|generating|ready|failed|expired|archived&trigger=manual|schedule&from=&to=&page=&limit=` → `{ reports: [<report view as in GET /reports> + organization: { id, name, type }], page, limit, total }` (newest first; `from` / `to` filter `created_at`).
- `GET /admin/reports/:reportId` → the same body as `GET /reports/:reportId` (`report`, `snapshot`, `document`, `attribution`). **404** `not_found`.
- `GET /admin/reports/:reportId/pdf` → `application/pdf`; **409** `not_ready` / `expired` / `file_missing`.

## Support tickets (Phase 13b)

**Customer side** (`/api/v1/support/tickets`, any organization role; a client_user sees only its own tickets):
- `POST /support/tickets { subject, category?: billing|technical|account|data|other, message, location_id? }` → **201** `{ id, number: "TCK-000001", subject, category, status: "open", priority, location_id, messages, last_message_at, last_message_by, created_at, closed_at, thread: [{ id, author: { kind, name }, body, created_at }] }`
- `GET /support/tickets?status=&page=&limit=`, `GET /support/tickets/:ticketId` (with `thread`)
- `POST /support/tickets/:ticketId/messages { message }`: status back to `open` (also reopens a resolved ticket); **409** `ticket_closed` on a closed one.
- `POST /support/tickets/:ticketId/close`

Team replies appear as `{ "kind": "team", "name": "MyPageSEO team" }`; internal notes are never shown.

**Statuses:** `open` (waiting for the team) → `in_progress` → `waiting_on_customer` (after a team reply) → `resolved` → `closed`.

**Team side** (`/api/v1/admin/support/tickets`, `support.read` / `support.manage`):
- `GET …?status=&organization_id=&assigned_to=&unassigned=true&q=` (q: a number prefix such as `TCK-00` or words of the subject); each ticket adds `organization`, `created_by: { id, email }` and `assigned_to`.
- `GET …/counts` → `{ open, in_progress, waiting_on_customer, resolved, closed, unassigned_open }`.
- `GET …/:ticketId`: the full thread, internal notes included (`internal: true`).
- `POST …/:ticketId/messages { message, internal?: false }`: a reply sets `waiting_on_customer` and emails the customer; an internal note changes nothing for the customer. The first team message assigns the ticket to its author.
- `PATCH …/:ticketId { status?, priority?: low|normal|high, assigned_to?: <admin id> | null }`.

**Emails:** a new ticket and customer replies go to `SUPPORT_EMAIL`; team replies go to the customer with a link to `FRONTEND_URL/support/<id>`. Sent or logged per `EMAIL_TRANSPORT` (OPERATIONS.md "Email").

---

## Reviews and AI (Phase 18)

All paths are under `/api/v1/locations/:locationId/reviews`. **Deterministic first, AI only when the user asks**: lists, stats, flags, refresh and sending never use AI; drafts, analysis, appeal drafts and insights call OpenAI (model `gpt-5-nano` by default) and spend MyPageSEO tokens. Nothing runs in the background. Reviews need a GBP binding and v4 access; the monthly GBP sync also keeps them current.

**Flow on the Reviews page:** `GET summary` + `GET reviews` → `POST refresh` (button) → tick reviews → `POST drafts` (4-5 stars) or `POST analyze` → edit with `PUT :reviewId/draft` → `POST send`. Low ratings: the user writes the reply (`PUT :reviewId/draft`); a flagged or 1-3 star review can get an AI removal-report draft (`POST :reviewId/appeal-draft`) to paste into Google's tool.

### The review object

```json
{
  "review_id": "6abf0c…", "rating": 2, "comment": "They overcharged me for a simple drain clean.",
  "reviewer": { "display_name": "Sam Lee", "is_anonymous": false },
  "create_time": "2026-09-28T10:00:00.000Z", "update_time": "2026-09-28T10:00:00.000Z",
  "reply": null, "reply_state": "draft", "sent_at": null, "send_error": null,
  "draft": { "text": "Hi Sam, sorry the price felt high…", "source": "user", "edited": false, "generated_at": "…", "stale": false },
  "flags": [ { "code": "ai_serious", "source": "ai", "label": "AI analysis: serious complaint", "detail": "Price complaint" } ],
  "flag_level": "attention",
  "analysis": { "sentiment": "negative", "severity": "high", "suspicious_indicators": [], "summary": "Price complaint", "recommended_action": "Reply publicly and offer to talk.", "analyzed_at": "…", "stale": false },
  "appeal": null, "report_status": "not_reported",
  "ai_reply_eligible": true, "ai_reply_skip_reason": null, "appeal_eligible": true,
  "first_seen_at": "…"
}
```

- `reply_state`: `none` (no reply), `draft` (a draft waits), `sent` (a reply is on Google, from us or from elsewhere), `failed` (the last send failed: `send_error`).
- `flag_level`: `none`, `attention` (a human should look) or `suspicious` (possible Google policy issue). Show "Suspicious indicators", never "fake". System flag codes: `link`, `contact_info`, `promotional`, `duplicate_text`, `profanity`, `low_rating_burst` (suspicious); `repeat_reviewer`, `empty_low_rating`, `rating_text_mismatch` (attention). AI flags after an analysis: `ai_suspicious`, `ai_serious`. Each flag has a `label` to show.
- `stale: true` on a draft, analysis or appeal: the review changed since it was made.
- `ai_reply_eligible`: AI drafts for any rated review without a reply that isn't suspicious (Phase 9.1; before: 4-5 stars only); otherwise `ai_reply_skip_reason`.

### `GET /reviews/summary` (no AI)

```json
{
  "stats": { "total": 64, "average_rating": 4.6, "new_this_month": 3, "positive": 55, "negative": 9, "unreplied": 12,
             "awaiting_attention": 4, "flagged": 3, "suspicious": 1, "drafts_pending": 2, "replies_sent_this_month": 5,
             "last_review_at": "2026-09-30T10:00:00.000Z", "updated_at": "…" },
  "last_synced_at": "…", "last_refreshed_at": "2026-10-02T12:00:00.000Z", "next_refresh_allowed_at": "2026-10-02T12:15:00.000Z",
  "v4_enabled": true, "gbp_connected": true,
  "ai": { "configured": true, "paused_today": false, "token_costs": { "reply_drafts_per_10": 1, "analysis_per_10": 1, "appeal": 1, "insights": 2 }, "token_balance": 12 }
}
```

`awaiting_attention` = unreplied 1-3 star or flagged reviews. Show "Last synced" and the **Refresh Reviews** button from `last_refreshed_at` / `next_refresh_allowed_at`. Hide AI buttons when `ai.configured` is false; show the token cost on each AI button.

### `GET /reviews` (no AI)

Query: `rating=5` or `rating=4,5`, `replied=true|false`, `reply_state`, `flagged=any|suspicious|attention|none`, `has_draft=true|false`, `search`, `sort=newest|oldest|rating_asc|rating_desc`, `page`, `limit` (≤ 100). → `{ reviews: [review], page, limit, total, attribution }`.

### `POST /reviews/refresh` (Google, no AI)

Fetches new and updated reviews newest first and stops at the first one already stored, so it is usually one free Google call. Once per 15 minutes per location (`REVIEWS_REFRESH_MIN_MINUTES`).

```json
{ "refreshed_at": "…", "google_calls": 1, "new_reviews": 2, "updated_reviews": 0, "stats": { "total": 66, "…": "…" } }
```

**429** `{ reason: "rate_limited", next_allowed_at }`; **400** `gbp_not_connected`, `v4_access_pending`.

### `POST /reviews/drafts` (AI)

`{ "review_ids": ["…"], "regenerate": false }` (1-20 ids). Only eligible reviews (Phase 9.1: any rating, not suspicious) go to the AI, in batches of 10 (one request each). Drafts that exist for the same review text are returned free; a draft the user wrote or edited is never replaced unless `regenerate: true`.

```json
{ "drafts": [ { "review_id": "…", "reply_state": "draft", "draft": { "text": "Thanks Ann, glad the boiler's working again…", "source": "ai", "stale": false }, "…": "…" } ],
  "generated": 2, "reused": 0, "skipped": [ { "review_id": "…", "reason": "flagged" } ], "tokens_spent": 1 }
```

What the AI sees: the business name, category and city, up to 8 tracked keywords (used only if they fit), each review's rating and text, and the reviewer's **first name** only.

**Phase 9.1 (2026-10-09): every rating.** Drafts now cover 1-3 star reviews too (only `suspicious` ones are skipped: report those instead). Replies to 1-3 stars follow separate rules: acknowledge and apologise without admitting fault, no offers or compensation, an invitation to contact the business directly, never argue; they never use keywords. The skip reason `rating_not_eligible` no longer exists.

### `POST /reviews/drafts/all` (AI, Phase 9.1): "Draft all unreplied"

`{ "regenerate": false }`. Drafts every unreplied review that isn't suspicious and has no current draft, oldest first, **up to 50 per call** (about 10–15 s). Call again while `remaining > 0` ("Continue: 12 left"). The cost of the call is checked first: **402** `{ reason: "insufficient_tokens", cost, balance, reviews }` and nothing is spent. Drafts the user wrote or edited are kept unless `regenerate: true`.

```json
{ "drafted": 50, "remaining": 12, "tokens_spent": 5, "drafts": [ { "review_id": "…", "rating": 2, "reply_state": "draft", "draft": { "text": "Hi Sam, we're sorry the visit fell short…", "source": "ai" }, "…": "…" } ] }
```

The summary shows what the button would do: `ai.draftable` (reviews waiting for a draft), `ai.draft_all_cost` (tokens for all of them) and `ai.draft_all_max` (50). Then the user ticks drafts (or "select all drafts": `GET /reviews?has_draft=true&replied=false`) and sends them with `POST /reviews/send` (up to 100 ids per call).

### `PUT /reviews/:reviewId/draft`, `DELETE /reviews/:reviewId/draft`

`{ "text": "…" }` (1-4000 characters): save a reply written or edited by the user, for any rating. → the review.

### `POST /reviews/send`

`{ "review_ids": ["…"] }` (≤ 50). Publishes each review's draft on Google (replaces an existing reply). No AI.

```json
{ "results": [ { "review_id": "…", "status": "sent", "reason": null }, { "review_id": "…", "status": "skipped", "reason": "no_draft" } ], "sent": 1, "failed": 0 }
```

A failed send sets `reply_state: "failed"` and `send_error`; fix and send again. `DELETE /reviews/:reviewId/reply` removes a published reply (**400** `no_reply`).

### `POST /reviews/analyze` (AI)

`{ "review_ids": ["…"], "regenerate": false }`: sentiment, severity, suspicious indicators, a one-line summary and a recommended action per review; cached until the review changes. Adds `ai_suspicious` (indicators found) and `ai_serious` (high severity) flags. Reviews without text are skipped (`no_text`). Never reports anything to Google. → `{ reviews, analyzed, reused, skipped, tokens_spent }`.

### `POST /reviews/:reviewId/appeal-draft` (AI)

**Google has no API to report or appeal a review** (v4 offers list / get / reply only). This drafts the text; the user submits it in Google's Reviews Management Tool (`report_url`) and records the outcome.

```json
{ "review": { "…": "…" },
  "appeal": { "text": "This review promotes another business's website (www.…) and does not describe an experience with ours…", "policy_reason": "spam", "generated_at": "…", "stale": false },
  "report_url": "https://support.google.com/business/workflow/16726127", "tokens_spent": 1 }
```

`policy_reason`: `spam`, `off_topic`, `conflict_of_interest`, `offensive`, `harassment`, `hate_speech`, `personal_information`, `restricted_content` or `none_applies` (the text then says the review probably doesn't break a policy and a public reply is better). Only for flagged or 1-3 star reviews (**400** `not_eligible`). Cached until the review changes.

`PATCH /reviews/:reviewId/report-status { "status": "reported" | "appeal_submitted" | "removed" | "kept" | "not_reported" }` records it.

### `POST /reviews/insights` (AI), `GET /reviews/insights`

Sends monthly counts per rating and at most 60 recent review texts cut to 300 characters; the result is stored and served by `GET` until regenerated (**404** `no_insights` before the first).

```json
{ "generated_at": "…", "ai_model": "gpt-5-nano",
  "basis": { "reviews_total": 64, "reviews_sent": 60, "from": "…", "to": "…" },
  "insight": { "themes": [ { "theme": "price", "mentions": 6, "sentiment": "mixed" } ], "praise": ["Tidy work"], "complaints": ["Prices feel high for small jobs"], "observations": ["Ratings dipped in August"] },
  "tokens_spent": 2 }
```

### AI errors (every AI route)

| Status | `reason` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 402 | `insufficient_tokens` (+ `balance`, `cost`) | Not enough MyPageSEO tokens; link to buying tokens |
| 503 | `ai_not_configured` | No OpenAI key on the server |
| 503 | `ai_budget_reached` | The server-wide daily AI budget is used up; try tomorrow |
| 502 | `ai_failed` | OpenAI didn't answer; the tokens were refunded |

**Token costs** are set per plan by MyPageSEO admins (`PATCH /admin/billing/plans/:planId { ai_token_costs }`) and shown in `GET /billing` → `tokens.ai_costs` and in the reviews summary. Defaults: reply drafts 1 per started batch of 10 reviews, analysis 1 per started 10, appeal draft 1, insights 2. Reused results cost nothing.

**Dashboard (Phase 18):** `GET /dashboard` → `reviews` adds `new_this_month`, `positive`, `negative`, `awaiting_attention`, `flagged`, `suspicious`, `drafts_pending`, `replies_sent_this_month`, `last_review_at` and `needs_attention: [{ location_id, name, awaiting_attention, suspicious }]` once reviews are stored; agency table rows get `reviews: { rating, total, awaiting_attention, suspicious }`; recommended actions `reviews:attention` and `reviews:suspicious`.

**Dashboard (Phase 9):** recommended actions `posts:failed` (failed or rejected posts), `posts:approval` (posts waiting for approval) and `posts:stale` (a bound location with post data but nothing published in 30 days and nothing scheduled).

## GBP posts (Phase 9)

Paths are under `/api/v1/locations/:locationId/posts` unless shown in full. Write, schedule, publish, edit and delete Google Business Profile posts from the dashboard. A post moves `draft` → (`pending_approval` →) `scheduled` → `publishing` → `published`; `failed` means our call to Google failed (retry), `rejected` means Google's review rejected the post. Google is called only when a post is published (now, or by the job at its time), when a post that is on Google is edited or deleted, and on **Refresh posts**. Publishing needs a GBP binding and v4 access (`gbp_not_connected`, `v4_access_pending`).

**Flow on the Posts page:** `GET summary` + `GET posts` (or `GET calendar`) → editor: optional `POST media` (photo) → `POST posts` with `action: draft | schedule | publish` → edit with `PATCH :postId` → `POST :postId/schedule`, `/publish`, `/unschedule`, `/retry`, `/duplicate` → `DELETE :postId`. With approval on: `POST :postId/approve` / `reject`.

- **Types:** `standard` (text and/or one photo), `event` (title + start / end), `offer` (title + start / end, optional `coupon_code`, `redeem_url` (https), `terms`; no button: Google shows its own "View offer").
- **Button (`cta`):** `BOOK`, `ORDER`, `SHOP`, `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP` with an https `url`; `CALL` without a URL (uses the profile phone).
- **Dates** are the location's local calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) with an optional time (`HH:mm`); without a time the event spans the whole day.
- **Repeats (`recurrence`, events and offers only):** `daily`; `weekly` with `days_of_week` (empty = the weekday of the start); `monthly` with `day_of_month` **or** `week_of_month` (`FIRST`…`FOURTH`, `LAST`: "the second Saturday"); `ends_on` at most a year after the start. Google repeats the post itself.
- **Limits:** text ≤ 1,500 characters, title ≤ 58, one photo.
- `issues`: what still blocks scheduling or publishing (`[{ field, code, message }]`; empty = ready). A draft may be incomplete; scheduling or publishing an incomplete post is **422** `post_incomplete` with the same list.
- `warnings`: hints, never blocking: `phone_in_text`, `link_in_text` (Google often rejects these), `all_caps`, `many_emoji`, `no_button`, `short_text`.
- `error` on a failed or rejected post: `{ code, message, at }`. Codes: `google_rejected_request` (Google's message), `google_unavailable` (no answer; retry), `google_rejected` (Google's review rejected it), `reconnect_required`, `gbp_not_connected`, `v4_access_pending`, `media_url_not_public`, `media_unreachable`, `media_missing`, `publish_interrupted`, `gbp_unbound`, `location_removed`, `post_incomplete`.
- `source: google`: a post made on Google outside the app, imported by a sync or Refresh. It has no `media` (its photo is `google.media_url`) and can be edited and deleted.
- `google.missing: true`: the post was deleted on Google; it can only be deleted here.

### `GET /posts/summary`

```json
{
  "stats": { "drafts": 2, "pending_approval": 1, "scheduled": 3, "published": 14, "failed": 0, "rejected": 0,
             "published_last_30_days": 4, "last_published_at": "…", "next_scheduled_at": "2026-10-12T14:00:00.000Z", "updated_at": "…" },
  "settings": { "approval": "team", "default_cta": { "type": "CALL", "url": null }, "language_code": "en", "refreshed_at": "…" },
  "connection": { "gbp_connected": true, "v4_enabled": true, "photos_publishable": true },
  "you": { "role": "member", "needs_approval": true, "can_approve": false }
}
```

Use `you.needs_approval` to label the buttons "Send for approval" instead of "Publish" / "Schedule", and `you.can_approve` to show Approve / Reject. `photos_publishable: false` (a development server): photos can be uploaded but not published.

### `GET /posts`, `GET /posts/calendar`, `GET /api/v1/posts/calendar`

- List query: `status=draft,scheduled`, `type`, `source`, `from`, `to` (ISO; matches the published or scheduled time), `page`, `limit` (≤ 100) → `{ posts: [post], page, limit, total }`, most recently changed first.
- Calendar: `from`, `to` (ISO, at most 93 days) → `{ from, to, items: [{ post_id, location_id, type, status, source, date, summary, event, recurrence }] }`. `date` is `published_at`, else `scheduled_at`; undated drafts are not on the calendar.
- `GET /api/v1/posts/calendar?from=&to=&location_ids=a,b` (organization-wide; an agency sees every location it may see) adds `location_name` to each item and `locations: [{ location_id, name }]`.

### `POST /posts`

```json
{ "type": "standard", "summary": "…", "cta": { "type": "BOOK", "url": "https://example.com/book" }, "media_ids": ["6ac2…"],
  "action": "schedule", "scheduled_at": "2026-10-12T14:00:00Z" }
```

- `action`: `draft` (default; may be incomplete), `schedule` (needs `scheduled_at`, 2 minutes to 1 year ahead), `publish` (now).
- Language and the default button come from the posting settings when not given.
- Answer **201** with the post. Its `status` says what happened: `draft`, `scheduled`, `pending_approval` (approval required), `published`, `rejected` or `failed` (with `error`; the post stays and can be retried).

### `PATCH /posts/:postId`

Any post field (`null` or `""` clears one).
- **Published or rejected post:** Google is patched first with only the changed fields, so a refusal leaves the post unchanged (**502** with Google's reason).
- **Type:** can't change on a published post (**409** `type_change_on_published`; duplicate it instead).
- **Completeness:** scheduled, waiting and published posts must stay complete (**422**).
- **Approval:** a scheduled post edited by someone who needs approval goes back to `pending_approval`. An edited draft or failed post loses an earlier approval.

### Scheduling and publishing

- `POST :postId/schedule { "scheduled_at": "…" }`: from `draft`, `failed`, `scheduled` (reschedule) or `pending_approval`.
- `POST :postId/publish`: publish now.
- `POST :postId/retry`: same as publish, but only from `failed`.
- `POST :postId/unschedule`: back to `draft` (the job or the approval request is cancelled).
- `POST :postId/duplicate`: **201**, a new draft with the same content.
- `DELETE :postId` → `{ post_id, deleted: true, deleted_on_google }`.
- **409** `invalid_status` (with `status` and `allowed_from`) when the post is in the wrong state; **409** `post_changed` when it changed meanwhile (reload).

**Publishing is never doubled.** The job and "publish now" claim the post first. A post with a Google name is never created again. After a Google timeout the server looks for the post Google created before trying again. A safety job every 15 minutes finishes interrupted publishes and publishes scheduled posts whose job was lost.

### Approval

Owner setting `PUT /posts/settings { "approval": "off" | "team" | "client", "default_cta": { "type": "CALL" } | null, "language_code": "en" }` (**403** `owner_only`).
- `team`: a member's schedule / publish goes to `pending_approval`; an owner approves. The owner's own posts don't wait.
- `client` (the location must belong to a client, else **400** `no_client`): every post waits; a client user of that client approves. An owner may approve on the client's behalf (`approval.on_behalf: true`).
- `POST :postId/approve { "note": "…" }` → the post publishes at its `scheduled_at`, or now when it had none or the time has passed. `POST :postId/reject { "note": "Change the wording" }` → back to `draft` with `approval.decision: "rejected"`. Someone else gets **403** `not_an_approver`.
- No email notifications yet (Phase 15); `stats.pending_approval` and the dashboard action `posts:approval` show waiting posts.

### Photos

- `POST /posts/media` (multipart, field `file`): JPEG or PNG, ≤ 5 MB, at least 250×250. It is cropped to 4:3 (at most 1200×900, never enlarged) and saved as a JPEG without metadata.
- → **201** `{ media_id, kind: "upload", url, width, height, bytes, created_at }`.
- Errors: **400** `media_type`, `media_too_small`, `media_too_large`, `media_too_plain` (too little detail: under 10 KB), `media_unreadable`, `invalid_upload`.
- Put the `media_id` in a post's `media_ids`.
- `GET /posts/media` lists the location's photos (newest 50).
- `DELETE /posts/media/:mediaId` (**409** `media_in_use` while an unpublished post uses it).
- Photos no post uses are deleted after 30 days.
- `url` is public (`/m/<token>.jpg`, no login) because Google fetches it.

### `POST /posts/refresh`

Reads every post of the location from Google (free), updates states (a post Google's review rejected becomes `rejected`), imports posts made on Google, and marks posts deleted there.
- → `{ updated, imported, missing, refreshed_at, next_allowed_at }`.
- Once per 15 minutes (`POSTS_REFRESH_MIN_MINUTES`): **429** `refresh_too_soon`.
- The monthly GBP sync does the same.

## AI posts and auto-posts (Phase 9.1)

OpenAI only (text: `gpt-5-nano`; images: `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL`, default `gpt-image-1-mini`). Every AI action spends MyPageSEO tokens (`GET /billing` → `tokens.ai_costs`: `post_draft` 1, `post_image` 3 by default, admin-set). The tokens are refunded when OpenAI fails. Without a key: **503** `ai_not_configured`. Other errors: **402** `insufficient_tokens` `{ balance, cost }`, **503** `ai_budget_reached`, **502** `ai_failed`. Only public profile facts (name, category, city, description, services), tracked keywords and the last 5 post texts go to OpenAI.

### In the editor

- `POST /posts/ai-draft { "topic": "new rye loaf", "tone": "friendly", "type": "standard", "cta_type": "CALL", "variants": 2, "language_code": "en" }`
  - → `{ drafts: [{ summary, event_title, cta_type, image_idea }], tokens_spent, model }`
  - Nothing is saved. Put the chosen text into `POST /posts` with `"source": "ai"`.
  - The text never contains phone numbers, links, invented prices or offers.
- `POST /posts/ai-image { "prompt_hint": "fresh loaves on a wooden table" }` (or `{ "post_id": "…" }` to illustrate a post's text)
  - Optional `style`: `photo_scene`, `lifestyle_photo`, `detail_photo`, `flat_illustration`, `render_3d`, `watercolor` or `photo_wide`. Without it the style rotates per image, so a profile's images vary (realistic photos are part of the mix).
  - → **201** `{ media: { media_id, kind: "ai", url, width: 1200, height: 900 }, style, tokens_spent }`. Add the `media_id` to the post's `media_ids`.
  - Images never contain words, logos or brand names.
- `POST /posts/:postId/ai-regenerate { "text": true, "image": true, "topic": "holiday orders" }`
  - Gives new text and / or a new image to a post that is not on Google yet (draft, scheduled, waiting, failed).
  - → `{ post, tokens_spent }`. A scheduled post keeps its time; approval rules apply as for any edit.

### Auto-posts (series)

The user picks days, a time, themes and a tone. The server writes each post about `lead_hours` (48) before its time: text plus an image when `include_image`. The post appears in the posts list and calendar as `scheduled` (`source: "ai"`, `series_id`). If nobody touches it, it publishes on time. The user can edit it, regenerate it (`ai-regenerate`), unschedule it or delete it. Approval modes apply as for any post: a series created by a member waits for the owner in team mode, and every post waits for the client in client mode. **Creating a series is consent to its token spend** (default 4 tokens per post with an image, 1 without).

```json
POST /api/v1/locations/:locationId/post-series
{ "name": "Weekly tips", "cadence": { "kind": "weekly", "days_of_week": ["MONDAY", "THURSDAY"] }, "time_of_day": "09:00",
  "starts_on": "2026-10-12", "ends_on": null, "topics": ["sourdough tips", "weekend specials idea", "meet the bakers"],
  "tone": "friendly", "cta": { "type": "CALL" }, "include_image": true, "language_code": "en",
  "instructions": "Never mention gluten-free.", "lead_hours": 48 }
```

- **Cadence:** `{ kind: "weekly", days_of_week: [...] }`, `{ kind: "every_n_days", n: 1–30 }` (counted from `starts_on`) or `{ kind: "monthly", day_of_month: 1–28 }`.
- **Time:** `time_of_day` is in the location's time zone (`time_zone`; UTC when unknown).
- **Topics:** used in turn.
- **Button:** `cta` is the post's button; when null the AI may suggest "Call now".
- **Limits:** at most 3 active series per location. A GBP binding is required (**400** `gbp_not_connected`).

The series object:

```json
{ "series_id": "…", "location_id": "…", "name": "Weekly tips", "active": true, "cadence": { "kind": "weekly", "days_of_week": ["MONDAY", "THURSDAY"] },
  "time_of_day": "09:00", "time_zone": "America/Toronto", "starts_on": "2026-10-12", "ends_on": null, "topics": ["…"], "tone": "friendly",
  "cta": { "type": "CALL" }, "include_image": true, "language_code": "en", "instructions": null, "lead_hours": 48, "posts_generated": 4,
  "next_slots": ["2026-10-12T13:00:00.000Z", "…"],
  "last_error": { "code": "insufficient_tokens", "message": "Not enough tokens for this AI action.", "slot_at": "…", "at": "…" },
  "history": [ { "slot_at": "…", "post_id": "…", "outcome": "generated", "reason": null, "at": "…" } ],
  "created_at": "…", "updated_at": "…" }
```

- `last_error` is set while slots fail; it clears on the next success.
- **Failure codes:** `insufficient_tokens`, `ai_not_configured`, `ai_budget_reached`, `ai_failed`, `gbp_not_connected`. A failed slot leaves no post and is retried every hour until its time passes.
- `history` holds the last 20 outcomes, newest first. `reason: "image_failed"` means a text-only post was made.
- The dashboard shows `posts:series_problem`; `GET /posts/summary` → `stats.series_problems`.
- **Other routes:**
  - `PATCH /post-series/:id` changes future posts.
  - `POST /post-series/:id/pause` | `/resume`.
  - `GET /post-series/:id/preview?count=5` → `{ time_zone, slots: [{ slot_at, topic, generates_at }] }` (no AI).
  - `POST /post-series/:id/generate-next` → **201** `{ series, post }`: makes the next slot's post now, as a sample.
  - `DELETE /post-series/:id?keep_scheduled=false`: its scheduled posts go back to drafts unless `keep_scheduled=true`; published posts stay.

## Sales audit (Phase 19)

The staff dashboard's free audit, shown by sales staff in a meeting: one business, one keyword, **public data only** (Places API; no GBP connection). Staff are platform admins with `audits.run`: the **Sales Representative** role (`role_id` 8, created with `POST /admin/admins`), plus super admin and admin. Staff sign in with `POST /admin/auth/login` (the frontend can show that on its own staff login page). Every audit is visible only to the staff member who started it. **No history:** `DELETE` removes the audit, and one left open is deleted after `STAFF_AUDIT_TTL_HOURS` (24).

**What one audit measures:**
- **Heatmap:** the keyword searched from a fixed **7×7 grid within 5 km** of the business (49 points, spacing 1.667 km), one sample per point, ranks **to 30** (deeper is `not_found`, shown "30+"). Row 0 is the north edge, col 0 the west edge; the business is the center cell `(3, 3)`.
- **Summary:** `center_rank` (the rank at the business), `avg_rank` (over the points that didn't fail, 30+ counted as 31), `found_rate` (share of points in the top 30), `top3_rate`.
- **Who ranks higher (area ranking, 2026-10-06):** every business seen in a top 30 anywhere on the grid is ranked by its **average rank over the 49 points** (30+ counted as 31; ties: higher top-3 share, then higher top-30 share; an exact tie goes to the business). `result.basis` is `"area"`.
  - `higher`: the businesses with a better average (up to 10), in area order, then **the business's own row last** (`is_self: true`). Each row: `{ rank, name, address, is_self, avg_rank, top3_rate }`, where `rank` is the area position (`null` on the business's row when it wasn't in any top 30).
  - `competitors`: the area top 3 other businesses, with `avg_rank` and `top3_rate` added.
  - `summary.area_rank`: the business's area position. `result.area`: `{ entries, self_rank, ahead, seen, points }` (`ahead` = how many have a better average).
  - The names come from the named list at the centre (Pro), the top 3's Place Details, and a name + address lookup (Place Details) for any of the up to 10 still unnamed. If one can't be named: `higher: null` + `names_unavailable`.
  - Why: at its own address a business is nearly always #1, so the centre's list said "nobody ranks higher" while the business was outside the top 3 almost everywhere else (CHANGELOG `audit_area_ranking`).
- **Centre rank:** `summary.center_rank` is still the rank in the named list at the centre (the center cell uses it, so the two agree), but it's no longer the headline.
- **Quick GBP score:** the Public Score (rating, review count, category, hours, website, phone, Google's description) with a checklist (`good | partial | missing`, plus photos, informational), for the business and the **top 3 other businesses** at its location.

**Flow:**

```
GET    /api/v1/staff/audits/places/autocomplete?input=maple%20leaf&session=<uuid>   (per keystroke, debounced)
POST   /api/v1/staff/audits { place_id, session, keyword }                          → 201, status "queued"
GET    /api/v1/staff/audits/:auditId                                                 poll every 2–3 s until "done" / "failed" (about 15–30 s)
GET    /api/v1/staff/audits/:auditId/pdf                                             one PDF with both parts
DELETE /api/v1/staff/audits/:auditId                                                 "close" (deletes it)
```

Use one random session token (8–36 of `A-Za-z0-9_-`, e.g. a UUID) per search box and pass it to `POST /staff/audits`: the Place Details call ends the Autocomplete session, so the keystrokes are free. `GET /staff/audits` lists the caller's open audits (without results), so a reloaded page can find its audit again.

**`POST /staff/audits`** `{ "place_id": "ChIJneho2koPp0wRIbUtaCCIReA", "session": "3f0c2a8e-…", "keyword": "digital marketing agency" }` → **201**, the audit (as below) with `status: "queued"`, `result: null`. Errors: **400** `unsupported_country` (US and Canada only), `no_location`; **429** `daily_limit_reached` `{ limit, retry_after_seconds }` (`STAFF_AUDIT_DAILY_LIMIT` per staff member per 24 h, default 20); **503** `places_not_configured`; **502** `places_error`.

- Show `attribution.text` ("Google Maps") under business names and ratings, as on the other pages.

**`GET /staff/audits/:auditId/pdf`:** `application/pdf`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="audit-<business>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf"`. MyPageSEO branding; usually 2 pages: the ranking part (KPIs, heatmap, who ranks higher), then the quick score (KPIs, checklist, the comparison with the top 3, up to 5 "what to work on first" actions). **409** `audit_not_ready` before `done`.

**`DELETE /staff/audits/:auditId`** → `{ "deleted": true, "id": "6ac0…" }`. **404** `audit_not_found` for an unknown, closed, expired or another staff member's audit (every route).

**Cost per audit** (list prices): 1 Place Details for the business + 3 for the top 3 (Enterprise + Atmosphere, about $0.10 together), 1 names search (Pro, $0.032; a second when the business isn't in the top 20), and about 98 IDs-only searches (free). About **$0.13–0.17** per audit. Counted in the usage ledger as purpose `sales_audit` (`npm run cost:report` shows "(sales audits)").

## Free audit, marketing site (Phase 20)

The free tool on **mypageseo.com**: the same quick audit as the staff dashboard (Phase 19: one business, one keyword, a 7×7 grid within 5 km, ranks to 30, the quick score against the top 3, one PDF), as a lead magnet. Everything else on the marketing site stays on its own backend; **only this page calls this API** (`https://api.mypageseo.com/api/v1`). The marketing-site handoff, with the page flow and copy, is [MARKETING_CLAUDE_NOTE.md](MARKETING_CLAUDE_NOTE.md).

**Two stages:**
1. **Preview:** free for us (the IDs-only grid + 1 Place Details). The page shows the 4 headline numbers, the heatmap colours (no rank numbers) and the score number. The server strips the rest.
2. **Full:** after the visitor's email is verified with a 6-digit code. Who ranks higher, the checklist, the comparison with the top 3, the PDF, and the PDF by email.

**No login.** Instead:
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** on the start and the lead form (`turnstile_token` from the widget; one token per submission).
- The audit's **access token**, returned once by the start. Every later call sends it as the header **`X-Audit-Token`**. A wrong or missing token gets the same 404 as an unknown audit.

**Limits** (429, `reason: "limit_reached"`, `which`, `limit`, `contact_url`):
- 2 verified reports per **business**, per **email** and per **phone** in any 90 days (`FREE_AUDIT_LIMIT_PER_90_DAYS`). The business limit is checked at the start, email and phone at the lead form, and all three again at verification.
- 5 starts per **IP** per day (`which: "ip"`).
- A site-wide cap of 100 starts per day: `reason: "daily_cap_reached"`.
- Autocomplete: 100 per IP per hour and a site-wide daily cap.
- Codes: one per minute (`code_resend_too_soon`, `retry_after_seconds`), 5 per audit and 5 per email per hour (`too_many_codes`); 10 minutes each, 5 tries (`code_invalid` with `attempts_left`, then `too_many_attempts`: ask for a new code).

**The grid centre (`center`):**
- `{ "source": "business" }` (default): the business's address.
- `{ "source": "city", "place_id", "session" }`: a city / ZIP from `kind=city` autocomplete. For example, a Mississauga business checking Brantford. A business with no address on Google must use a city (`400 no_location`).

### `GET /public/audits/places/autocomplete?input=&session=&kind=business|city`

`{ "suggestions": [{ "place_id": "ChIJ…", "description": "Maple Leaf Plumbing, King St, Mississauga, ON", "main_text": "Maple Leaf Plumbing", "secondary_text": "King St, Mississauga, ON", "types": ["plumber", "establishment"] }], "attribution": { "provider": "Google", "text": "Google Maps" } }`

Use a separate random `session` (UUID) for the business box and the city box. Pass each to the start call, so the keystrokes are billed as part of the Place Details call.

### `POST /public/audits`

```json
{ "turnstile_token": "0.AbC…", "place_id": "ChIJ…business", "session": "6f1c…", "keyword": "emergency plumber",
  "center": { "source": "city", "place_id": "ChIJ…brantford", "session": "a93e…" } }
```

**201**, the view below plus `"access_token": "<64 hex>"`. Keep it (sessionStorage); it isn't shown again.

### `GET /public/audits/:auditId` (header `X-Audit-Token`)

Poll every 2–3 s while `polling` is true.
- **Preview:** about 15–25 s after the start.
- **Full report:** about 10 s after verification.

```json
{
  "id": "6ac2…", "stage": "preview_done", "preview_ready": true, "full_ready": false, "polling": false, "locked": true,
  "keyword": "emergency plumber", "center": { "source": "city", "label": "Brantford, ON, Canada" },
  "grid": { "size": 7, "radius_km": 5, "spacing_km": 1.667 },
  "business": { "name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing", "address": "1 King St, Mississauga, ON", "rating": 4.2, "user_rating_count": 18, "category": "Plumber", "country": "CA" },
  "preview": {
    "summary": { "center_rank": 9, "center_status": "ok", "avg_rank": 21.4, "found_rate": 0.55, "top3_rate": 0.04, "points": 49, "failed_points": 0 },
    "cells": [{ "row": 0, "col": 0, "bucket": "low" }, "… 49"],
    "score": { "score": 52, "grade": "D" }
  },
  "result": null, "pdf_available": false,
  "lead": { "submitted": false, "email_masked": null, "verified": false, "code_expires_at": null, "attempts_left": null },
  "warnings": [], "failure_reason": null, "created_at": "…", "finished_at": null,
  "attribution": { "provider": "Google", "text": "Google Maps" }
}
```

- `stage`: `preview_queued → preview_running → preview_done → (after verification) full_queued → full_running → done`, or `failed`.
  - `failure_reason`: `search_failed`, `places_not_configured`, `enqueue_failed`, `timed_out` or `internal_error`. Offer "run again", which is a new start.
- `bucket`: `pack` (1–3), `visible` (4–10), `low` (11–20), `invisible` (21–30), `not_found` (30+) or `error`.
- `preview.summary.center_rank` comes from the grid. The full report replaces it with the rank in the named list at the centre, so it can move by a place or two.
- **Area ranking (2026-10-06):** `preview.summary.area_rank` is the business's place when every business on the grid is ranked by its average rank. `preview.businesses_ahead` is how many have a better average: "3 businesses outrank you in your area", with no names until the email is verified. `center.lat` / `center.lng` (both views) are the grid centre, for a map behind the heatmap.
- **When `stage` is `done` and the lead is verified:**
  - `locked: false` and `preview: null`
  - `business` gains `checklist`, `score.parts`, `website`, `phone` and the other public facts
  - `result` has the same shape as the sales audit: `cells` with `rank`, `summary` (with `area_rank`), `basis: "area"`, `higher` (up to 10 ahead across the area, then the client's own row; rows carry `avg_rank` and `top3_rate`), and `competitors` (the area top 3, each with `facts`, `score`, `checklist`, `avg_rank` and `top3_rate`)
  - `result.area` carries counts only here: `{ self_rank, ahead, seen, points }`
  - `pdf_available: true`

### `POST /public/audits/:auditId/lead` (header `X-Audit-Token`)

```json
{ "turnstile_token": "0.XyZ…", "business_name": "Maple Leaf Plumbing", "name": "Pat Doe", "email": "pat@example.com", "phone": "(905) 555-0100", "consent": true }
```

The response is the view with `lead: { submitted: true, email_masked: "p***@example.com", verified: false, code_expires_at, attempts_left: 5 }`. A 6-digit code is emailed.
- The email is lower-cased.
- The phone must be a US or Canadian number. It's stored as `+19055550100` (`400 invalid_phone` otherwise).
- Sending again with other details (a typo in the email) is allowed, subject to the code limits.

### `POST /public/audits/:auditId/lead/resend`, `POST /public/audits/:auditId/verify { "code": "123456" }`

On success the view has `lead.verified: true` and `stage: "full_queued"`, or still `preview_*`: the full stage then follows the preview automatically. Keep polling until `done`.

### `GET /public/audits/:auditId/pdf`

`application/pdf`. The same PDF is emailed to the lead when the report is ready. Returns **409** `audit_not_ready` before then.

**Retention:** an audit that is never verified is deleted after 7 days. A verified lead and its report are kept `FREE_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (730) for the admin panel.

### Admin: `/admin/leads/audits` (`leads.read`: super admin, admin, sales; `leads.manage`: super admin, admin)

- `GET /admin/leads/audits?from=&to=&verified=true|false&q=&page=&limit=` →
  ```
  { leads: [{ id, created_at, stage, keyword,
              business: { name, address, rating, user_rating_count }, center: { source, label },
              lead: { business_name, name, email, phone, verified_at } | null,
              summary: { center_rank, avg_rank, top3_rate } | null, score: { score, grade } | null }],
    page, limit, total }
  ```
  `q` searches the name, email, phone digits, business and keyword.
- `GET /admin/leads/audits/export`: the same filters, as CSV.
- `GET /admin/leads/audits/:leadId`: the whole audit and the lead, including `consent_at` and `consent_text_version`.
- `GET /admin/leads/audits/:leadId/pdf`: **409** `audit_not_ready` unless the audit is verified and done.
- `DELETE /admin/leads/audits/:leadId` (`leads.manage`): for privacy requests; audit-logged as `admin.free_audit.delete`.
